    "correctAnswer": ["Fusion splicer"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A fusion splicer is used to repair a break in a fibre-optic cable, or to create long fibre-optic cable lengths by splicing multiple cables together. A cable crimper is used to join the internal wires of a twisted pair cable with metallic pins housed inside a plastic connector, such as an RJ-45 connector. A cable snip or cable cutter is used to cut copper cables into shorter lengths from a longer spool of wound cable. A media converter is a layer 1 networking device that connects two different media types, such as a copper twisted pair cable and a fibre-optic cable."

    "explanation": "The iPerf tool is used to create TCP and UDP data streams and measure the throughput of a given network. The iPerf tool is well-suited to test the throughput of switches and its results can be used to create a new network performance baseline. The traceroute command is used on Linux, Unix, and OS X devices to show details about the path that a packet takes from a host to a target and displays information about each hop in the path. A protocol analyser is used to capture, monitor, and analyse data transmitted over a communication channel. A bandwidth speed test measures the speed of data transfer between a host and a test server using the device's network connection. A bandwidth speed test is most commonly used to test the connection between a client device and an internet server or website."

    "question": "A network installation team has been asked to run Cat 5e cabling from a ground-floor networking closet to a new networking closet on the first floor. However, they've encountered an issue where some of the offices connected to the first-floor closet are functioning correctly, while others are facing problems. The team suspect that cable length issues might be causing the trouble. How can the team best resolve this situation and ensure all offices connected to the first-floor closet are working properly?",
    "options": [
      "Install a small switch in each office to increase the signal",
      "Install a hub in the first-floor networking closet to increase the signal",
      "Install a switch in the first-floor networking closet to increase the signal",

    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": [
      "Install a switch in the first-floor networking closet to increase the signal"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The best option is to install a switch in the networking closet on the first floor, connecting to the cables coming from the ground-floor closet and then to the cables on the first-floor patch panel. This will act as a repeater to boost the signal strength over the Cat 5e cable, effectively resetting the cable length to 0 metres before leaving the closet. While a repeater may be a good option, a switch is more effective in this case since there are so many cables, and repeaters usually only work for an individual cable. A hub would similarly work but would introduce a signal collision domain for all 24 computers. This would drastically decrease the performance of the network. Finally, we don't want to include a switch in each office, as this is a bad security practice and an inefficient use of resources. It is easier to manage and administer a single, centralised switch in the network closet."

    "question": "A user in an office recently installed a new wireless printer on the network. She can successfully print to the printer when connected locally, but she encounters an issue when trying to get the printer connected to the Internet for firmware updates. All other office users can access the Internet without any problems, but they cannot connect to the new wireless printer. All users in this part of the office are using wireless connections. What is the most likely cause of the issue that the office users are experiencing with the new wireless printer?",
    "options": [
      "They misconfigured the gateway on the wireless printer",
      "They installed the printer in infrastructure mode",
      "They installed the printer in the wrong subnet",
      "They installed the printer in ad-hoc mode"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["They installed the printer in ad-hoc mode"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The printer is most likely in ad-hoc mode, which is also known as IBSS. In this type of network, devices talk directly to each other but have no connection outside of this 'self-created' network. Since only one user can connect to the printer, that user and the printer are likely a part of the ad-hoc network. The printer should have been installed on the regular wireless network in the office as part of the infrastructure mode to ensure everyone can access it. If the wireless printer's gateway was misconfigured, this would have explained why it cannot connect to the internet but would not explain why none of the other users on the same wireless network cannot reach it. When devices are communicating on the same local area network segment, such as a wireless network, they operate using layer 2 and do not use a gateway. The printer is likely not on the wrong subnet because one user was still able to connect to it properly."

      "Broadcast storm"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Collisions"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A collision is the result of two devices on the same Ethernet network attempting to transmit data at the exact same time. Collisions are a common occurrence in half-duplex networks but should not occur in a full-duplex switched environment. A hub operates in half-duplex mode and not in full-duplex. A broadcast storm is the result of an excessive amount of broadcast or multicast traffic on a computer network. A broadcast storm can consume sufficient network resources and render the network unable to transport normal network traffic. A duplicate MAC address occurs when two or more devices are responding to data requests as if they are the only device on the network with that physical address. One indication of this occurring is when a switch continually changes the port assignments for that address as it updates its content-addressable memory (CAM) table to reflect the physical address and switchport bindings. Asymmetric routing is when network packets leave via one path and return via a different path (unlike symmetric routing, in which packets come and go using the same path)."

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Network routing performance can be improved and broadcast traffic can be reduced by adding a multilayer (layer 3) switch. Creating a VLAN provides LAN segmentation within the network and the multilayer switch can conduct the routing between VLANs as needed. Just adding a single router would only create two broadcast domains, but adding the multilayer switch and configuring VLANs would allow you to add as many broadcast domains as you need. Each VLAN is its own broadcast domain. A bridge is a layer 2 device, it does not break apart broadcast domains. A firewall isn't designed to break apart broadcast domains, this is a job for a router or a layer 3 switch."

If the trunk port has a native VLAN that differs from the tag placed on the frame as it entered the access port, the switch leaves the tag on the frame and sends the tagged frame along to the next switch or switches. If the trunk port’s native VLAN is the same as the access port's VLAN, then the switch drops the tag and sends the untagged frame out of the trunk port."

In video conferencing, a codec is a software (or can be hardware) that compresses (encodes) raw video data before it is transmitted over a network. Generally, audio/video conferencing systems utilise the H.323 protocol with various codecs like H.263 and H.264 to operate. A 56k modem is a legacy device, also called a dial-up modem. These devices are too slow to allow an IP-based video conferencing system deployment. RS-232 is a standard protocol used for serial communication, and is too slow to support IP-based video conferencing systems. Near Field Communication (NFC) is a set of short-range wireless technologies, typically requiring a distance of 4cm or less to initiate a connection. NFC is not used with IP-based video conferencing systems."

    "explanation": "The Spanning Tree Protocol is part of the 802.1d standard and avoids loops in the switching network (layer 2). The 802.1q standard is used to define virtual LANs (VLANs) on an ethernet network. RIPv2 is a layer 3 distance-vector protocol for local and wide-area networks, and does not prevent or avoid loops by default. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a layer 3 link-state routing protocol that was developed for IP networks and is based on the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm.

This method can increase bandwidth, and therefore throughput. LACP can also provide network redundancy and load balancing. The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast storms that result from them. STP is defined in the IEEE 802.1d standard. A Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) is used by STP to prevent the bridge loops.

This causes the wireless client to disconnect from the wireless network and then reconnect. During that reconnection, an attacker can conduct a packet capture of the authentication handshake and use that to attempt to brute force the network's pre-shared key. An evil twin is a rogue wireless access point that masquerades as a legitimate Wi-Fi access point so that an attacker can gather personal or corporate information without the end-user's knowledge. A rogue access point is any access point installed on a network without the network owner's permission. For example, if an employee connected a wireless access point to a wall jack in their office so that they can use their smartphone or tablet, this would be considered a rogue access point.

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "MAC filtering will control access to the network by restricting access to only certain devices. MAC address filtering allows you to block traffic coming from certain known machines or devices. The router uses the MAC address of a computer or device on the network to identify it and block or permit access. Traffic coming in from a specified MAC address will be filtered depending upon the policy. In this scenario, you should implement a whitelist that only allows approved MAC addresses to connect to and communicate over the wireless network."

      "MAC spoofing"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["MAC spoofing"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "MAC spoofing is a technique for changing a factory-assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device. Public wireless networks can be configured to use MAC filtering to block access to devices once they reach a certain time limit. It appears that after 30 minutes, the restaurant's wireless access points are adding your MAC address to the block list. If you change your MAC address through MAC spoofing, you can reconnect to the network for another 30 minutes without any issues. Since the wireless network provides the IP address, IP spoofing would not successfully allow you to reconnect since the MAC filtering would block your access before obtaining an IP. IP spoofing is a method of modifying the source address in the packet header to make the receiving computer system think the packet is from a trusted source, such as another computer on a legitimate network, and accept it. A dictionary attack is a method of breaking into a password-protected computer, network, or other IT resource by systematically entering every word in a dictionary or list file. A brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting every possible combination for a password or PIN until they crack it."

It provides multiple factors that a user must know to obtain access. For instance, if one factor is successfully broken, there will be few others that the individual attempting to enter the system must overcome. Multi-factor authentication is an electronic authentication method in which a user is granted access to a website or application only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism: knowledge, possession, inherence, location, or actions."

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Most large enterprise networks will use the same models of switches across much of the network. This allows them to keep spare switches on-site to use as replacements if a production switch fails. By maintaining a configuration backup of each production switch, it allows a network technician to remove the fault switch, install the new switch, and reload the configuration backup to the new switch. Using this method, a skilled network technician can restore a network switch within just a few minutes. While having a network diagram or VLAN configuration may be helpful, they will not expedite the recovery like a configuration backup will. The router image would be useless in this scenario since it was a switch that failed and requires replacement."

These types of plans address issues like cybercrime, data loss, and service outages that threaten daily work. System life cycle plans, also known as life cycle planning, describes the approach to maintaining an asset from creation to disposal. In the information technology world, we normally have a 5-phase lifecycle that is used for all of our systems and networks: Planning, Design, Transition, Operations, and Retirement. An acceptable use policy (AUP) is a set of rules applied by the owner, creator, or administrator of a network, website, or service, that restrict the ways in which the network, website, or system may be used and sets guidelines as to how it should be used.

A baseline is a process for studying the network at regular intervals to ensure that the network is working as designed. An archive is a backup of the configurations for the network device. System Logging Protocol (Syslog) uses port 514 and is a way network devices can use a standard message format to communicate with a logging server.

For example, Syslog messages can be generated by Cisco routers and switches, servers and workstations, and collected in a central database for viewing and analysis. A proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource. The Domain Name System (DNS) uses port 53 and is a hierarchical and decentralised naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.

A logical diagram is used to illustrate the flow of data across a network and is used to show how devices communicate with each other. These logical diagrams usually include the subnets, network objects and devices, routing protocols and domains, voice gateways, traffic flow, and network segments in a given network. Wiring diagrams are used to clearly label which cables are connected to which ports. The more in-depth wiring diagrams will include a floorplan or rack diagram, so you can see how the cables are run in the physical environment. A wireless site survey is the process of planning and designing a wireless network to provide a wireless solution that will deliver the required wireless coverage, data rates, network capacity, roaming capability, and quality of service (QoS).

    "correctAnswer": ["Throughput"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Throughput is an actual measure of how much data is successfully transferred from the source to a destination. Bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given network. Now, bandwidth is more of a theoretical concept that measures how much data could be transferred from a source to a destination under ideal conditions. Therefore, we often measure throughput, instead of bandwidth, to monitor our network performance. Latency is the measure of time that it takes for data to reach its destination across a network. Usually, we measure network latency as the round-trip time from a workstation to the distant end and back. Jitter is a network condition that occurs when a time delay in the sending of data packets over a network connection occurs. Jitter is a big problem for any real-time applications you may be supporting on your networks, like video conferences, voice-over IP, and virtual desktop infrastructure clients."

    "explanation": "A fire suppression system is an engineered set of components that are designed to extinguish an accidental fire in a workplace or data centre. Fire suppression systems can use wet pipe sprinklers, pre-action sprinklers, and special suppression systems. A wet pipe system is the most basic type of fire suppression system, and it involved using a sprinkler system and pipes that always contain water in the pipes. A pre-action system minimises the risk of accidental release from a wet pipe system. With a pre-action system, both a detector actuation like a smoke detector and a sprinkler must be tripped prior to water being released. Special suppression systems, like a clean agent system, use either a halocarbon agent or inert gas. When releases, the agents will displace the oxygen in the room with the inert gas and suffocates the fire.

    "explanation": "System life cycle planning describes the approach to maintaining an asset from creation to disposal. In the information technology world, we normally have a 5-phase lifecycle that is used for all of our systems and networks: Planning, Design, Transition, Operations, and Retirement. A business continuity plan is a document that outlines how a business will continue operating during an unplanned disruption in service. A business continuity plan is more comprehensive than a disaster recovery plan and contains contingencies for business processes, assets, your human capital and business partners, and essentially every other aspect of the business that might be affected. A disaster recovery plan is a documented, structured approach that documents how an organisation can quickly resume work after an unplanned incident. These unplanned incidents include things like natural disasters, power outages, cyber-attacks, and other disruptive events. An incident response plan contains a set of instructions to help our network and system administrators detect, respond to, and recover from network security incidents. These types of plans address issues like cybercrime, data loss, and service outages that threaten daily work."

The site survey report will contain a floorplan of the areas surveyed with the wireless coverage areas and signal strengths notated on it. Wiring diagrams are used to clearly label which cables are connected to which ports. The more in-depth wiring diagrams will include a floorplan or rack diagram, so you can see how the cables are run in the physical environment. A physical network diagram is used to show the actual physical arrangement of the components that make up the network, including cables and hardware. A logical diagram is used to illustrate the flow of data across a network and is used to show how devices communicate with each other. These logical diagrams usually include the subnets, network objects and devices, routing protocols and domains, voice gateways, traffic flow, and network segments in a given network."

    "correctAnswer": ["Latency"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Latency is the measure of time that it takes for data to reach its destination across a network. Network latency is usually measured as the round-trip time from a workstation to the distant end and back. Bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given network, but it is more of a theoretical concept that measures how much data could be transferred from a source to a destination under ideal conditions. Throughput is an actual measure of how much data is successfully transferred from the source to a destination. Therefore, we often measure throughput, instead of bandwidth, to monitor our network performance. Jitter is a network condition that occurs when a time delay in the sending of data packets over a network connection occurs. Jitter is a big problem for any real-time applications you may be supporting on your networks, like video conferences, voice-over IP, and virtual desktop infrastructure clients."

All data generated and stored at the primary site is immediately replicated and backed up at the disaster recovery site. A warm site is a type of facility an organisation uses to recover its technology infrastructure when its primary data centre goes down. A warm site features an equipped data centre but no customer data. A cold site is a backup facility with little or no hardware equipment installed.

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Guest network allows anyone to access the Internet without having the ability to disrupt the intranet. This network should be logically isolated from the corporate intranet of the office. Generally, these guest networks will directly connect to the internet with little to no security or monitoring on that network. This is a feature known as guest network isolation. A DMZ or demilitarised zone is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organisation's external-facing services to an untrusted, usually larger, network such as the Internet. A DMZ is generally used to host servers, not wireless guests or clients. A screened subnet refers to the use of one or more logical screening routers as a firewall to define three separate subnets: an external router, that separates the external network from a perimeter network, and an internal router that separates the perimeter network from the internal network. While a screened subnet could be used to isolate a guest network, it alone would not provide any wireless capability and therefore is not the best answer to this question. Multi-user MIMO is a set of multiple-input and multiple-output technologies for multipath wireless communication, in which multiple users or terminals, each radioing over one or more antennas, communicate with one another. MU-MIMO is a part of the 802.11ac wireless standards, but it alone would not isolate the wireless users from the corporate intranet."

    "correctAnswer": ["DoS"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A DoS attack or denial-of-service attack works by overloading a server with multiple requests (more than it can handle), thus eventually knocking the server offline. When a denial-of-service attack occurs, there will be an increase in the amount of web traffic on the server, but since that traffic is not being sent by legitimate customers there will be no financial transactions occurring. ARP spoofing is a type of attack in which a malicious actor sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local area network. This results in the linking of an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent email designed to trick a human victim into revealing sensitive information to the attacker or to deploy malicious software on the victim's infrastructure like ransomware. Bluejacking is the sending of unsolicited messages over Bluetooth to Bluetooth-enabled devices such as mobile phones, PDAs, or laptop computers, sending a vCard which typically contains a message in the name field to another Bluetooth-enabled device via the OBEX protocol."

    "explanation": "Network segmentation in computer networking is the act of splitting a computer network into subnetworks, each being a network segment. Advantages of such splitting are primarily for increasing performance and improving security through isolation. Link aggregation is the combining of multiple network connections in parallel by any of several methods, in order to increase throughput beyond what a single connection could sustain, to provide redundancy in case one of the links should fail, or both. Port mirroring is used on a network switch to send a copy of network packets seen on one switch port to a network monitoring connection on another switch port. Redundancy is an operational requirement of the data centre that refers to the duplication of certain components or functions of a system so that if they fail or need to be taken down for maintenance, others can take over while maintaining high availability of your network and systems.

    "options": ["RST", "FIN", "ICMP Time Exceeded", "Redirect"],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["RST"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": " RST (Reset) is the most likely response that the client would receive if it is trying to connect to the wrong TCP port. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that a connection needs to be established between the client and the server before data can be exchanged. During the connection establishment process, the client sends a SYN (Synchronize) packet to the server, and the server responds with a SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge) packet. If the client is trying to connect to the wrong TCP port, the server will not respond with a SYN-ACK packet, and instead, it will send a RST packet to terminate the connection attempt."

    "correctAnswer": ["ISCSI"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface) is a cost-effective way to connect to a SAN over a long distance. It uses standard Ethernet networks and TCP/IP protocol to transmit SCSI commands, allowing it to run over existing IP networks. This makes it less expensive to implement than Fibre Channel (FC) or Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) which require specialized cabling and equipment. Additionally, iSCSI can be used to connect to both local and remote storage devices, making it a suitable option for the branch office scenario you described."

    "correctAnswer": ["Exclusion range"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Involves specifying a range of IP addresses within the DHCP scope that the DHCP server will not assign to devices. By setting an exclusion range, the DHCP server won't hand out these addresses dynamically, allowing you to reserve them for devices with static IP assignments. This is the ideal method when you need to allocate a specific set of addresses within a DHCP scope for static assignment."

    "question": "Due to a surge in business, a company is onboarding an unusually high number of salespeople. The salespeople are assigned desktops that are wired to the network. The last few salespeople to be onboarded are able to access corporate materials on the network but not sales-specific resources. Which of the following is MOST likely the cause?",
    "options": [
      "The switch was configured with port security.",
      "Newly added machines are running into DHCP conflicts.",
      "The IPS was not configured to recognize the new users.",
      "Recently added users were assigned to the wrong VLAN"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Recently added users were assigned to the wrong VLAN"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "In this scenario, the salespeople are assigned desktops that are wired to the network. The fact that the salespeople can access corporate materials on the network suggests that their desktops are able to communicate with the network. However, they cannot access sales-specific resources, which could be an indication that they have been assigned to the wrong VLAN.VLANs are used to segment a network into smaller logical pieces, which helps to improve security and network performance. VLANs are often used to group devices by function, department, or location. When a new group of users, such as the salespeople in this scenario, is added to a network, they need to be assigned to the appropriate VLAN to access resources that are specific to their role.If the recently added users were assigned to the wrong VLAN, they would not be able to access resources that are specific to their role. In this case, it is likely that the desktops were configured to use the wrong VLAN, which is preventing the salespeople from accessing sales-specific resources."

    "correctAnswer": ["Configure port security using MAC filtering."],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Configure port security using MAC filtering would be the BEST technique to address the concern. Port security can be used to restrict access to an interface by limiting the MAC addresses that are allowed to send packets through the port. By configuring port security with MAC filtering, only the authorized MAC addresses of the cameras will be allowed to send packets through the switch ports, preventing rogue devices from connecting to the organization's resources."
