    "question": "As you arrive to work this morning, you look up at the building and notice a microwave antenna pointing to another antenna on top of your company's support building across the street. Which of the following network topologies does BEST represent this network connection over the microwave link?",

    "correctAnswer": [
      "Point-to-point"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A point-to-point connection best represents this connection since it is used as a Campus Area Network connection to directly connect the two buildings. A campus area network (CAN) is a computer network that spans a limited geographic area. CANs interconnect multiple local area networks (LAN) within an educational or corporate campus. A mesh topology connects every node directly to every other node. This creates a highly efficient and redundant network, but it is expensive to build and maintain. A point-to-multipoint connection would involve one antenna that can connect with multiple other antennas. A satellite television network is an example of a point-to-multipoint connection since a single ground antenna can transmit to a satellite and then that same signal can be received by multiple customer antennas connected to receivers. Peer-to-peer connections involve a group of computers that are linked together with equal permissions and responsibilities for processing data."

    "explanation": "To answer this question, you must be able to perform a basic subnetting calculation. First, you need to determine the number of IP addresses that will be needed. In this scenario, you have 5 clients that will each need an IP address, but you also need one IP address for the network and a second IP for the broadcast. This means you need 7 IP addresses total. IP addresses are assigned in multiples of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256). Since we need 7 IP addresses, we need to round up to a block of 8. To symbolise a CIDR block with 8 IP addresses, we would use /29, which is 2^3 = 8."

    "explanation": "Point-to-point topology establishes a dedicated connection between two endpoints, making it ideal for long-distance communication without the need for intermediate devices, ensuring efficient data transfer over considerable distances. Hub and Spoke / Star topology relies on a central hub, adding complexity and potential points of failure for long-distance connections. Hybrid topology is a combination of two or more different types of network topologies, such as Star, Bus, Ring, or Mesh. While Hybrid topology can offer flexibility and redundancy within a network, it typically involves more complex configurations and isn't specifically designed for establishing a direct, dedicated connection between two remote locations over a long distance. Bus topology involves a single cable connecting all devices, which isn't suitable for long-distance direct connections."

The smallest subnet that can fit 15 IPs is a /28 (16 IPs). A /28 will borrow 4 host bits and assign those to the network portion of the subnet mask. This would create a subnet with 2^4 available host IP addresses, or 16 total IP addresses. Of the 16 IP addresses, there are 14 available for clients to use, one for the network ID, and one for the broadcast address."

The loopback address is used to send a test signal sent to a network destination to diagnose problems. A broadcast address is an IP address that is used to target all systems on a specific subnet network instead of single hosts. A multicast address is a logical identifier for a group of hosts in a computer network that are available to process datagrams or frames intended to be multicast for a designated network service. The address shown is not a broadcast or multicast address. A public address is routable over the internet, but ::1 is a loopback address and therefore not publicly routable on the internet."

When a client computer is configured to use automatic addressing (DHCP), APIPA assigns a class B IP address from 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255 to the client if the DHCP server is unavailable. A static IP is an IP address that is manually assigned to a client and does not change. A public IP address is the outward-facing (public-facing) IP address assigned to a client.

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A switch is networking hardware that connects devices on a computer network by using packet switching to receive and forward data to the destination device. A switch operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and makes switching decisions based upon MAC addresses. Each switchport on a switch is a separate collision domain, but all switchports are in a common broadcast domain. A hub is a network hardware device for connecting multiple Ethernet devices together and making them act as a single network segment. A hub operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. All devices connected by a hub are in a single collision domain and a single broadcast domain, therefore they must use half-duplex for communication and CSMA/CD. A wireless access point is a networking device that allows other Wi-Fi devices to connect to a wired network. A wireless access point operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model to extend the wired network into the wireless domain. A repeater is a networking device that receives a signal and then rebroadcasts it to extend the distance covered by a network. A repeater can operate either as a wired or wireless repeater."

    "explanation": "ARP spoofing is a type of attack in which a malicious actor sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local area network. This results in the linking of an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer, server, or gateway on the network. A reflective DNS attack is a two-step attack used in DDoS attacks. The attacker sends a large number of requests to one or more legitimate DNS servers while using a spoofed source IP of the targeted victim. The DNS server then replies to the spoofed IP and unknowingly floods the targeted victim with responses to DNS requests that it never sent. An evil twin is a rogue wireless access point that masquerades as a legitimate Wi-Fi access point so that an attacker can gather personal or corporate information without the end-user's knowledge. IP spoofing is the creation of Internet Protocol (IP) packets which have a modified source address in order to either hide the identity of the sender, to impersonate another computer system, or both."

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "When two devices on the same network are assigned the same IP address, it leads to IP conflicts. This can cause intermittent connectivity issues as the network cannot reliably differentiate between the two devices when routing traffic. An Incorrect VLAN assignment affects the entire VLAN and typically results in devices not being able to connect to the network or reach services on different VLANs. The DHCP lease time determines how long a device can hold an IP address before renewing it, which could cause a device to lose its IP address, but would not cause intermittent connectivity issues or ongoing address conflicts. Access Control Lists (ACLs) are used to permit or deny traffic based on various criteria, if misconfigured, it would completely block devices from accessing network resources, not result in intermittent connectivity."

    "question": "In a large office building, the IT department recently implemented a new subnetting scheme to accommodate the growing number of devices on the network. However, some employees are reporting issues with connecting to certain network resources. Despite having proper network connectivity, they are unable to access shared folders and printers. The IT team suspects a network configuration issue is causing the problem. Which of the following could be the likely cause of the reported network issues?",
    "options": [
      "Incorrect subnet mask",
      "Misconfigured DNS server",
      "Outdated network switches",
      "Interference from neighboring Wi-Fi networks"
    ],

    "correctAnswer": [
      "Incorrect subnet mask"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "An incorrect subnet mask can lead to devices being unable to communicate properly within the network. A misconfigured DNS server might cause name resolution issues but wouldn't directly relate to subnetting problems. Outdated network switches might lead to performance issues but wouldn't directly cause subnetting-related problems. While interference from neighboring Wi-Fi networks could disrupt connectivity, it wouldn't specifically cause issues related to subnetting."

    "question": "Which of the following errors would be received if an ethernet frame greater than 1518 bytes is received by a switch?",
    "options": [
      "Runt",
      "Encapsulation error",
      "Giant",
      "CRC error"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": [
      "Giant"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A giant is any ethernet frame that exceeds the 802.3 frame size of 1518 bytes. A runt is an ethernet frame that is less than 64 bytes in size. Encapsulation is a process by which a lower-layer protocol receives data from a higher-layer protocol and then places the data into the data portion of its frame. Cyclic Redundancy Checksum (CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data as it transits the network."

    "question": "Christina recently purchased a new Android smartphone and is going on a trip. At the airport, she found a public wireless network called \"FreeAirportWiFi\" and connects to it. She noticed a question mark (?) icon showing in the toolbar next to the Wi-Fi icon. Christina attempts to open a webpage but gets an error of \"The page cannot be displayed.\" She begins to troubleshoot the device by verifying that the airplane mode is disabled, Bluetooth is enabled, and tethering is enabled. Next, Christina attempts to make a phone call, which works without any issues. Which of the following is MOST likely the issue with Christina's smartphone?",
    "options": [
      "The smartphone's SIM card is deactivated",
      "The smartphone is connected to the FreeAirportWifi but is not authenticated yet",
      "The smartphone can only support 3G data networks",
      "The smartphone does not have a valid data plan enabled"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": [
      "The smartphone is connected to the FreeAirportWifi but is not authenticated yet"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "When an Android smartphone is connected to the Wi-Fi but shows a question mark (?) next to the Wi-Fi's radio icon, this indicates that there is a lack of internet connectivity on the current wireless network. It appears that Christina's smartphone is fully connected to the FreeAirportWiFi, but she has not completed the authentication. These types of public wireless networks often have a captive portal or redirect page with the Acceptable Use Policy that must be accepted before giving the smartphone full connectivity to the internet. Once the acceptance is made to the captive portal, the smartphone is logically connected to the internet, and the question mark will be removed."

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A packet capture tool is used to collect data packets being transmitted on a network and save them to a packet capture file (pcap) for later analysis. Packet capture tools are useful when attempting to capture traffic for malware analysis as a cybersecurity analyst. A WiFi analyser is used to gather information about the available wireless networks, troubleshoot wireless networking issues, ensure optimal router placement, and identify existing coverage areas. A port scanner is used to determine which ports and services are open and available for communication on a target system. An IP scanner is used to monitor a network's IP address space in real-time and identify any devices connected to the network."

      "Visual fault locator"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A visual fault locator (VFL) is specifically designed to identify breaks, micro-bends, and other faults in fiber optic cables. A multimeter measures electrical properties such as voltage, current, and resistance, which are not applicable to fiber optic cables. A spectrum analyser is used to analyse the frequency spectrum of signals, typically for radio frequencies. An OTDR is used for testing the integrity of fiber optic cable, while useful for assessing overall cable health, it may not pinpoint specific faults like breaks or bends."
