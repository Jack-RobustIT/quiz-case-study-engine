    "options": [
      "By matching a MAC address to an IP address within the DHCP scope",
      "By letting the network switches assign IP addresses from a reserved pool",

    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": [
      "By matching a MAC address to an IP address within the DHCP scope"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "When the client requests an IP address by sending a message on the network to the DHCP server, the DHCP server will assign an IP from its DHCP scope to the client and reserve it based on its MAC address. DHCP reservations allow the DHCP server to pre-set an IP address to a specific client based on its MAC address. This ensures that the client will always get the same IP address from the DHCP server when it connects to the network. DHCP reservations are usually used with servers or printers on your internal network and are rarely used with end-user or client devices."

    "question": "Duncan, a network administrator, is tasked with configuring a new Domain Name System (DNS) server for his organisation's internal network. The objective is to ensure that internal domain names are resolved efficiently to their corresponding IP addresses to support seamless intranet and internet access for the employees. To achieve this, Duncan must decide on the appropriate type of DNS zone to configure on the server. Which type of DNS zone should Duncan configure to map domain names to IP addresses?",
    "options": [
      "A forward zone",
      "An authoritative zone",

    "correctAnswer": [
      "A forward zone"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A forward zone is the correct type of DNS zone for Duncan to configure, as it maps domain names to their corresponding IP addresses, which is essential for resolving internal domain names efficiently. An authoritative zone is a type of DNS zone where the server has the authority to manage the DNS records for a specific domain, but the scenario focuses on the general need for domain name to IP address mapping, not specifically on external web services. A secondary zone helps provide redundancy and load balancing for a primary DNS server but does not directly relate to the requirement of mapping domain names to IP addresses. A reverse zone is used for the opposite purpose of a forward zone, mapping IP addresses back to their domain names, which is not the primary requirement mentioned in the scenario."

SNMP is widely used in network management for network monitoring. SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems organised in a management information base (MIB) which describes the system status and configuration. These variables can then be sent by the clients to the server as alerts or “trap” messages. SNMP operates using ports 161 and 162. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is an internet standard communication protocol for electronic mail transmission. NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection Systems) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations, but it does not push alerts from a client to a server. SMS (Short Message Service) is a text messaging service component of most telephone, Internet, and mobile device systems that allows for the exchange of short text messages, but it does not send alerts from a client to server for network monitoring."

SOCKS (Socket Secure) is a network protocol that facilitates communication with servers through a firewall by routing network traffic to the actual server on behalf of a client. A reverse proxy is a type of proxy server where the servers return resources to the client where it would appear to the network that it originated from the reverse proxy server itself and is used to conduct load balancing. Teredo tunneling is used to tunnel IPv6 traffic over an IPv4 network using UDP datagrams."

This technique allows for the observation and analysis of network traffic without interrupting or altering the data flow, making it suitable for detecting unauthorised access and suspicious activities. utilising API integration to pull logs is a method for accessing data, but it does not describe duplicating traffic for real-time analysis. Deploying a network tap can indeed copy traffic for analysis, but the scenario hints at a configuration change on the network switch (i.e., port mirroring) rather than adding a physical device inline with the network traffic. An IDS monitors and analyses network traffic for suspicious activities, but the scenario specifically mentions a method that duplicates traffic for analysis, which is a function of port mirroring."

Decreasing the operational overhead costs of the device is not the primary reason for firmware updates. While updates can sometimes improve efficiency or functionality, their main purpose is not to reduce costs directly. Decreasing the physical wear and tear on the device is incorrect because firmware updates are software changes that do not directly impact the physical condition of the device. While firmware can optimise the operation of the hardware, it does not reduce physical wear and tear. optimising features and ensuring compatibility with older standards are benefits of firmware updates, but they do not outweigh the importance of security and compatibility with new standards."

    "correctAnswer": [
      "/26"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "To answer this question, you must be able to perform a basic subnetting calculation. First, you need to determine the number of IP addresses that will be needed. In this scenario, you have 57 clients that will each need an IP address, but you also need one IP address for the network and a second IP for the broadcast. This means you need 59 IP addresses total. IP addresses are assigned in multiples of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256). Since we need 59 IP addresses, we need to round up to a block of 64. To symbolise a CIDR block with 64 IP addresses, we would use /26, which is 2^6 = 64."

In this example, the CIDR notation is /30, so each subnet will contain 4 IP addresses. Since the IP address provided is 77.81.12.14/30, the network ID is 77.81.12.12/30, the first router is 77.81.12.13/30, the second router is 77.81.12.14/30, and the broadcast address is 77.81.12.15/30."

    "question": "You are currently working as a firewall technician. You have received a request to open up a few ports on the firewall to allow a newly installed VoIP system to operate properly. The installer has requested that the ports associated with SIP, RDP, H.323, and RTP be opened to allow the system to operate properly. Which of these ports are NOT typically used by a VoIP system?",
    "options": [
      "H.323",
      "SIP",
      "RDP",
      "RTP"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": [
      "RDP"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) uses port 3389 and is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection. RDP is not typically used by a VoIP system. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) uses ports 5060 and 5061, and is a signaling protocol for initiating, maintaining, and terminating real-time sessions that include voice, video, and messaging applications. The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a network protocol for delivering audio and video over IP networks. RTP is used in communication and entertainment systems that involve streaming media, such as telephony, video teleconference applications including WebRTC, television services, and web-based push-to-talk features. The H.323 protocol addresses call signaling and control, multimedia transport and control, and bandwidth control for point-to-point and multi-point conferences."
