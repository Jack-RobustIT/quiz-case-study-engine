    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Port Security is designed to restrict access to a network by filtering MAC addresses. It allows administrators to define which devices are permitted to connect to specific switch ports. VLANs are used for logical segmentation of networks but don't directly control access based on MAC addresses. DHCP Snooping helps prevent unauthorised DHCP servers but doesn't control access based on MAC addresses. STP is a protocol for preventing loops in network topologies and doesn't address MAC filtering for access control."

SCADA systems are used by industrial organisations and companies in the public and private sectors to control and maintain efficiency, distribute data for smarter decisions, and communicate system issues to help mitigate downtime. Industrial control system (ICS) is a collective term used to describe different types of control systems and associated instrumentation, which includes the devices, systems, networks, and controls used to operate and/or automate industrial processes. Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) is a way to reduce cost and accelerate service deployment for network operators by decoupling functions like a firewall or encryption from dedicated hardware and moving them to virtual servers. Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is an advanced distance-vector routing protocol that is used on a computer network for automating routing decisions and configuration. Channel Service Unit/Data Service Unit (CSU/DSU) is a hardware device about the size of an external modem that converts digital data frames from the communications technology used on a local area network (LAN) into frames appropriate to a wide-area network (WAN) and vice versa."

    "question": "Susan wants to be able to use her iPad on the corporate network, but there is no wireless network available in her office. She decides to buy a wireless router at the local store and plug it into the network wall jack in her office. Which of the following types of attacks did Susan perform?",
    "options": [
      "Evil twin",
      "VLAN hopping",
      "Deauthentication",

    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": [
      "Rogue access point"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A rogue access point is any access point installed on a network without the network owner's permission. For example, if an employee connected a wireless access point to a wall jack in their office so that they can use their smartphone or tablet, this would be considered a rogue access point. An evil twin is meant to mimic a legitimate hotspot provided by a nearby business, such as a coffee shop that provides free Wi-Fi access to its patrons. An evil twin is a type of rogue wireless access point that masquerades as a legitimate Wi-Fi access point so that an attacker can gather personal or corporate information without the end-user's knowledge. This type of attack may be used to steal the passwords of unsuspecting users by monitoring their connections or phishing, which involves setting up a fraudulent website and luring people there. Susan did not try to perform an evil twin attack, but instead she naively added a rogue access point to the company network. A deauthentication attack is a type of denial-of-service attack that targets communication between a user and a Wi-Fi wireless access point by sending a deauthentication frame to the victim's machine. VLAN Hopping is an attack where the attacker is able to send traffic from one VLAN into another by either double tagging the traffic or conducting switch spoofing."

      "Configuring a VLAN"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "VLANs allow for logical segmentation of a network, enabling different departments to be isolated while still connected to the same physical network infrastructure. This ensures network segmentation. Additionally, VLANs can be configured to facilitate traffic monitoring. While firewall rules can control traffic flow, they don’t provide the same level of isolation as a VLAN. NAT translates IP addresses but does not inherently provide network segmentation. Packet capture is a diagnostic tool, not a method for network segmentation."

    "explanation": "Segmentation is the best method to reduce the risk to an embedded ICS system from a network-based compromise. Additionally, you could disable unused services to reduce the footprint of the embedded ICS. Many of these embedded ICS systems have a large number of default services running. So, by disabling the unused services, we can better secure these devices. By segmenting the devices off the main portion of the network, we can also better protect them. A NIDS might detect an attack or compromise, but it would not reduce the risk of the attack succeeding since it can only detect it. Patching is difficult for embedded ICS devices since they usually rely on customised software applications that rarely provide updates."

    "correctAnswer": [
      "Intrusion prevention system"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Since this question is focused on the ICS/SCADA network, the best solution would be implementing an Intrusion Prevention System. ICS/SCADA machines utilise very specific commands to control the equipment and to prevent malicious activity. You could set up strict IPS rules to prevent unknown types of actions from being allowed to occur. Log consolidation is a good idea, but it won't prevent an issue and therefore isn't the most critical thing to add first. Automated patch management should not be conducted, as ICS/SCADA systems must be tested before conducting any patches. Often, patches will break ICS/SCADA functionality. Antivirus software may or may not be able to run on the equipment, as well, since some ICS/SCADA systems often do not rely on standard operating systems like Windows."

    "correctAnswer": [
      "Application-aware firewall"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A web application firewall (WAF) or application-aware firewall would detect both the accessing of random ports and TLS encryption and identify it as suspicious. An application-aware firewall can make decisions about what applications are allowed or blocked by a firewall, and TLS connections are created and maintained by applications. A stateless packet inspection firewall allows or denies packets into the network based on the source and destination IP address or the traffic type (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.). A stateful packet inspection firewall monitors the active sessions and connections on a network. The process of stateful inspection determines which network packets should be allowed through the firewall by utilising the information it gathered regarding active connections as well as the existing ACL rules. Neither a stateless or stateful inspection firewall operates at layer 6 or layer 7, so they cannot inspect TLS connections. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. An IDS only monitors the traffic on the network, it cannot block traffic."

This allows the attacker to intercept, eavesdrop, and/or manipulate data, which is a direct threat to data transmitted over the WAN. Firewall evasion involves circumventing firewall restrictions, but it doesn't intercept or manipulate data on the network like an on-path attack. DNS poisoning redirects domain name resolutions, affecting internet access, but it doesn't directly target data transmission between parties."

    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Piggybacking attack is a social engineering attempt by cyber threat actors in which they trick employees into helping them gain unauthorised access into the company premises. The big difference between tailgating and piggybacking is permission. Tailgating is when an unauthorised person physically follows an authorised person into a restricted corporate area or system. With tailgating, the authorised person doesn't know the unauthorised person is walking behind them. With Piggybacking, the authorised person will allow the unauthorised person to enter the secure area using the authorised person's access credentials. Shoulder surfing is a type of social engineering technique used to obtain information such as personal identification numbers, passwords and other confidential data by looking over the victim's shoulder. Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent email designed to trick a human victim into revealing sensitive information to the attacker or to deploy malicious software on the victim's infrastructure like ransomware."

      "Block all ICMP traffic to and from the DMZ"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A ping sweep is a basic network scanning technique used to determine which of a range of IP addresses map to live hosts (computers). A ping sweep occurs when an ICMP echo request message is sent to each target in a network and then waits for the ICMP echo replies to report if the target was available or not. To disable ping sweeps on a network, administrators can block ICMP echo requests from outside sources or block any outbound ICMP echo replies from being transmitted from their network. If you only blocked inbound echo replies to the DMZ, it would still allow an attacker to send an inbound echo request and the servers to send an outbound echo reply which would not stop the ping sweep from occurring. Ping sweeps are conducted using ICMP by default, not UDP, therefore disabling UDP on the servers will not stop a ping sweep. If you disable TCP/IP on the server in the DMZ, you will prevent them from operating properly and impose a self-created denial-of-service against your own servers."

A zero-day attack happens once that flaw, or software/hardware vulnerability, is exploited and attackers release malware before a developer has an opportunity to create a patch to fix the vulnerability. The Smurf attack is a distributed denial-of-service attack in which large numbers of Internet Control Message Protocol packets with the intended victim's spoofed source IP are broadcast to a computer network using an IP broadcast address. Multiplexing is a method by which multiple analog or digital signals are combined into one signal over a shared medium to share a scarce resource. Multiplexing is not a type of exploit or attack but is heavily used to increase the bandwidth of wireless networks and fiber optic connections."

    "explanation": "Trusted networks are considered safe and are generally inside the company’s firewall, whereas untrusted networks are outside and not directly controlled by the company’s security policies. The concept of trusted vs. untrusted networks is fundamental in network security, distinguishing between the internal, more secure areas of a network (trusted) and the external, potentially less secure areas (untrusted). The classification of networks as trusted or untrusted is not based on the sharing of sensitive data but on their location relative to the company's security measures, like a firewall. The use of encryption is not the primary factor distinguishing trusted from untrusted networks. Encryption can be employed in both types of networks for securing data transmissions. The key distinction does not revolve around additional authentication for access, but rather the assumed level of security and control."

    "explanation": "Without a properly configured ACL, there is no additional security provided by a VLAN. A VLAN (virtual local area network) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2). Adding a VLAN to a network provides segmentation of the traffic and traffic must be routed between the VLANs. This allows network administrators the opportunity to allow or deny traffic into or out of a given VLAN for additional security by using access control lists. The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks and operates at layer 2 of the OSI model. The basic function of STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them. A split-horizon route advertisement is a method of preventing routing loops in distance-vector routing protocols by prohibiting a router from advertising a route back onto the interface from which it was learned. A hold down timer is a function of a router that prevents a route from being updated for a specified length of time (in seconds). A hold down timer allows for the routers in a topology to have sufficient time to reach convergence and be updated when a route fails."

    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Shoulder surfing is a type of social engineering technique used to obtain information such as personal identification numbers, passwords, and other confidential data by looking over the victim's shoulder. Piggybacking is when an unauthorised person physically follows an authorised person into a restricted corporate area or system. Tailgating attack is a social engineering attempt by cyber threat actors in which they trick employees into helping them gain unauthorised access into the company premises. The big difference between tailgating and piggybacking is permission. With piggybacking, the authorised person doesn't know the unauthorised person is walking in behind them. With tailgating, the authorised person will allow the unauthorised person to enter the secure area using the authorised person's access credentials. Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent email designed to trick a human victim into revealing sensitive information to the attacker or to deploy malicious software on the victim's infrastructure like ransomware."

    "correctAnswer": [
      "Generation of false positive alerts"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The primary disadvantage encountered by Finley is the generation of false positive alerts by the anomaly alerting/notification system. While these systems are crucial for identifying potential security threats by monitoring for deviations from normal network behavior, they can sometimes incorrectly identify benign activities as threats, leading to unnecessary investigations and potential distraction from actual issues. Implementing an anomaly alerting/notification system does not inherently increase the complexity of network configuration Anomaly alerting/notification systems are designed to enhance threat detection efficiency by automatically identifying unusual activities. The primary issue Finley experienced was not a higher demand on these resources but the challenge of managing and responding to false positive alerts."

It typically includes information about the location of network devices, such as routers, switches, and servers. A logical diagram is used to illustrate the flow of data across a network and is used to show how devices communicate with each other. These logical diagrams usually include the subnets, network objects and devices, routing protocols and domains, voice gateways, traffic flow, and network segments in a given network. Wiring diagrams are used to clearly label which cables are connected to which ports. The more in-depth wiring diagrams will include a floorplan or rack diagram, so you can see how the cables are run in the physical environment. A wireless site survey is the process of planning and designing a wireless network to provide a wireless solution that will deliver the required wireless coverage, data rates, network capacity, roaming capability, and quality of service (QoS). The site survey report will contain a floorplan of the areas surveyed with the wireless coverage areas and signal strengths notated on it."

    "explanation": "Throughput is an actual measure of how much data is successfully transferred from the source to a destination. Bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given network. Now, bandwidth is more of a theoretical concept that measures how much data could be transferred from a source to a destination under ideal conditions. Therefore, we often measure throughput, instead of bandwidth, to monitor our network performance. Latency is the measure of time that it takes for data to reach its destination across a network. Usually, we measure network latency as the round-trip time from a workstation to the distant end and back. Jitter is a network condition that occurs when a time delay in the sending of data packets over a network connection occurs. Jitter is a big problem for any real-time applications you may be supporting on your networks, like video conferences, voice-over IP, and virtual desktop infrastructure clients."

Such emergencies or disasters might include a fire or any other case where business cannot occur under normal conditions. A disaster recovery plan is useful (and usually a piece of the larger business continuity plan), but it is insufficient for the long-term strategy needed to support business operations during an extended outage. The key difference between a DRP and BCP is that a DRP is focused on recovering from a disaster while a BCP is focused on maintaining operations before, during, and after the disaster.

This connection allows a Windows administrator to see and control what is on a remote computer's screen. RDP authentication and session data is always encrypted. This means that a malicious user with access to the same network cannot intercept credentials or interfere or capture anything transmitted during the session. Secure Shell (SSH) uses port 22 to securely create communication sessions over the Internet for remote access to a server or system. Telnet uses port 23 to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection, but sends its data in plaintext making it an insecure protocol.

This VIP can then distribute incoming traffic across multiple web servers in the backend. This approach ensures high availability and load balancing, making it an ideal solution for maintaining the accessibility of the website even if one server becomes unavailable. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices on a network, not for load balancing or high availability of web servers. Network Address Translation (NAT) is primarily used to translate private IP addresses to a public IP address for outbound internet access, not for distributing incoming web traffic across multiple servers.

The IT team needs to ensure secure and efficient access to the application for users worldwide without exposing individual server IP addresses or allocating a public IP for each server. Given the goal of conserving IP addresses while maintaining secure and efficient access to the application, which concept should the IT team implement?",

    "correctAnswer": [
      "Deploying PAT to allow multiple servers to share a single public IP address using different ports."
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Deploying Port Address Translation (PAT) is the correct choice for allowing multiple servers within a private network to share a single public IP address while differentiating the traffic using unique ports. This approach conserves IP addresses and maintains secure and efficient user access to the application without exposing individual server IP addresses. Implementing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a secure connection for users to the private network but is not specifically related to conserving IP addresses or directly facilitating public access to a web application. Network Address Translation (NAT) alone translates public IP addresses to private ones but does not specify the use of unique ports to differentiate between servers sharing a single public IP. Assigning a public IP address to each server is not efficient for IP address conservation and increases the risk of exposing sensitive servers directly to the internet."

    "explanation": "Enabling band steering allows the router to automatically allocate devices between the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands based on each device's signal strength, capabilities, and current network congestion, optimising performance for all devices. Switching all devices to the 2.4GHz band may increase coverage but can lead to overcrowding on the band, worsening performance issues. Disabling the 6GHz band would not be relevant in optimising performance between 2.4GHz and 5GHz devices and also assumes the router supports the 6GHz band, which was not indicated.

This ensures that each device receives the correct voltage for safe and efficient operation, preventing damage due to overvoltage or undervoltage conditions. Ensuring compatibility with the PDU's output is important, but the primary concern is whether the device can safely operate with the facility's power supply voltage. Establishing proper grounding and bonding is vital for safety and equipment protection, but it is a separate concern from verifying voltage requirements to ensure device compatibility with the power supply. While calculating overall power consumption is a critical task in planning network infrastructure, it is not directly related to verifying individual device voltage requirements."

By adjusting the metric value, Stanley can influence the routing protocol's decision-making process to favor the most efficient route. Administrative distance affects the preference of routes from different routing protocols, not the efficiency of route selection within a routing protocol.

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "In the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) state machine, the Listening state is where the port listens to BPDU (Bridge Protocol Data Unit) frames to ensure no loops occur in the network before it can transition to the Learning and eventually to the Forwarding state. This state is crucial for preventing network loops by allowing the switch to process BPDUs without learning MAC addresses. The Learning state allows the switch to learn MAC addresses and does not forward frames. The Blocking state prevents the use of looped paths by not forwarding frames and listening for BPDUs. The Disabled state is not an active STP state but rather indicates that the port is administratively disabled and will not participate in frame forwarding or STP."

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Dynamic routing protocols automatically adjust to network changes, sharing information between routers to optimise paths without the need for manual reconfiguration. This capability significantly reduces the administrative overhead associated with maintaining route information in large and complex networks. While dynamic routing can handle complex network topologies, it does not necessarily simplify network design requirements; it optimises route selection within existing topologies. Dynamic routing does not inherently increase security through manual route verification; this is a separate consideration. Dynamic routing protocols often increase bandwidth usage due to route advertisement and updates, contrary to reducing it."
