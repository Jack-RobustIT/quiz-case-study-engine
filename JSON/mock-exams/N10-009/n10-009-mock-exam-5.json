    "correctAnswer": [
      "Port Tagging"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The 801.q standard is used to define VLAN tagging (or port tagging) for Ethernet frames and the accompanying procedures to be used by bridges and switches in handling such frames. Traffic should be properly tagged when combined over a single trunk port to ensure they are not sent to the wrong VLAN by mistake. If VLAN tagging is not enabled, all of the VLAN traffic will be sent to the native or default VLAN, VLAN 1. By default, VLAN 1 is enabled and all unused ports are assigned to it. The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast storms that result from them. STP is defined in the IEEE 802.1d standard. The IEEE 802.1x standard is a network authentication protocol that opens ports for network access when an organisation authenticates a user's identity and authorises them for access to the network. This defines port security. The user's identity is determined based on their credentials or certificate, which is confirmed by the RADIUS server. The Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) is a part of IPv6 that operates at the data link layer of the OSI Internet model and is responsible for gathering various information required for internet communication, including the configuration of local connections and the domain name servers and gateways used to communicate with more distant systems."

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A captive portal is used in this scenario to control access to the Wi-Fi network. It redirects users to a login page or terms and conditions acceptance page before providing full internet access. MAC filtering involves controlling access based on device MAC addresses, WEP encryption is a security protocol, and SSID broadcasting relates to the visibility of the network name. None of these directly involve the redirection and authentication process seen in a captive portal setup."

      "The need for regular updates in response to network changes",
      "Scalability in large, complex networks"
    ],
    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "Scalability in large, complex networks is a disadvantage of static routing because the manual configuration becomes impractical and error-prone in such environments. The need for regular manual updates in response to network changes is a significant disadvantage of static routing. Since static routes are configured manually, any change in the network topology requires the network administrator to manually update the routing table, making it less scalable and more labor-intensive for dynamic or large networks. Lower overhead on router resources is actually an advantage of static routing, as it does not require the computational and bandwidth resources needed by dynamic routing protocols to maintain and update routing tables. Simplicity in small or highly secure environments is an advantage of static routing, not a disadvantage."

      "NFC"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Near-Field Communication (NFC) is a set of communication protocols for communication between two electronic devices over a distance of 4 cm or less. NFC offers a low-speed connection with a simple setup that can be used to bootstrap more-capable wireless connections. NFC is used with payment systems like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Google Pay since it supports two-way communication, unlike RFID which only supports one-way data transfers. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology standard that is used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances using UHF radio waves in the ISM bands, from 2.402 GHz to 2.48 GHz, and building personal area networks. Bluetooth is often used to create peer-to-peer connections between two devices for a distance of up to 10 meters. Wi-Fi is a family of wireless network protocols, based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards, which are commonly used for local area networking of devices and Internet access, allowing nearby digital devices to exchange data by radio waves. Wi-Fi can provide high speeds and cover a maximum distance of up to 150 meters."

The Spanning Tree Protocol operates at Layer 2 of the OSI model to detect switching loops. STP is defined in the IEEE 802.1d standard. The Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) enables you to assign multiple physical links to a logical interface that will appear as a single link to a route processor. LACP is used to combine multiple network connections in parallel to increase throughput beyond what a single connection could sustain and to provide redundancy in case one of the links should fail. LACP is defined in the IEEE 802.3ad standard. Split horizon is used by routing protocols at layer 3 to prevent routing loops, and it does not affect switching loops."

    "explanation": "The main function of the Main Distribution Frame (MDF) is to serve as the central point for external network connections and to manage the distribution of these connections to intermediate points or IDFs, thereby facilitating an organised and efficient network structure. The MDF's role is more about connection distribution than directly increasing data transfer speeds. While MDFs and IDFs support wireless connections, the primary purpose of the MDF is not to manage wireless networks but to serve as the central network hub. IDFs serve as secondary distribution points that extend connectivity from the MDF, not the other way around."

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Omnidirectional antennas send the signal out equally in all directions. Therefore, it will provide the best coverage since it is located in the centre of the field. Unidirectional antennas transmit the signal in only one direction and would not provide adequate coverage. Bidirectional antennas transmit the signal in only two directions and would not provide adequate coverage. A Yagi antenna is a type of unidirectional antenna that can focus the transmission over a longer distance but would not be appropriate in this case since you need 360-degree coverage."

    "correctAnswer": [
      "Decreased routing table size"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "EIGRP's automatic summarisation can decrease the routing table size by summarising routes at network boundaries, reducing memory and processing requirements on routers. Automatic summarisation has no impact on the encryption of routing updates; EIGRP does not inherently encrypt routing updates. Automatic summarisation does not directly increase the risk of routing loops; it can actually help prevent them by simplifying the routing table. EIGRP's support for non-IP protocols is not improved by automatic summarisation; it supports various protocols through protocol-dependent modules."

    "explanation": "The telecom company usually terminates the circuits at the Main Distribution Facility (MDF) at the demarcation point. A main distribution frame (MDF or main frame) is a signal distribution frame for connecting equipment (inside plant) to cables and subscriber carrier equipment (outside plant). An intermediate distribution frame (IDF) is a distribution frame in a central office or customer premises, which cross connects the user cable media to individual user line circuits and may serve as a distribution point for multipair cables from the main distribution frame (MDF) to individual cables connected to equipment in areas remote from these frames. A Krone block is an insulation-displacement connector for telecommunications networks used in Europe and is similar to a 110 punch down block. A patch panel is a device or unit featuring a number of jacks, usually of the same or similar type, for the use of connecting and routing circuits for monitoring, interconnecting, and testing circuits in a convenient, flexible manner. Since a T1 line is provided by a telecommunications service provider, it should terminate at your demarcation point."

Circuit-switched connections, such as ISDN, establish temporary connections for each session, resulting in variable bandwidth and higher latency. Packet-switched connections share network resources and may experience fluctuations in performance. Frame Relay is a legacy packet-switched technology that does not offer the same level of reliability and performance as a dedicated leased line."

Aware of the challenges in the crowded 2.4 GHz band, they contemplate the best approach for channel selection. Why might Charlie opt for non-overlapping channels in this environment?",
    "options": [
      "To leverage the increased range provided by lower frequency channels",
      "To maximise data throughput by using the most crowded channels",
      "To ensure a uniform signal strength across all access points",

    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": [
      "To avoid interference between closely located access points"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Charlie's decision to opt for non-overlapping channels is a strategic move to avoid interference between closely located access points, which is crucial in a busy co-working space. In the 2.4 GHz band, channels 1, 6, and 11 are non-overlapping and provide the best opportunity to minimise co-channel and adjacent-channel interference. This approach ensures more reliable and interference-free Wi-Fi connectivity by allowing multiple APs to operate in close proximity without negatively impacting each other's performance. Maximising data throughput by using the most crowded channels would likely result in increased interference and decreased network performance. Ensuring a uniform signal strength across all access points is not specifically achieved by the selection of non-overlapping channels. The main objective of this choice is to reduce interference. Leveraging the increased range provided by lower frequency channels does not directly address the issue of minimising interference."

    "correctAnswer": [
      "Configure the connection to full-duplex mode to allow simultaneous sending and receiving of data."
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Configuring the connection to full-duplex mode enables the server and switch to send and receive data simultaneously, maximising the data transfer efficiency for large, bidirectional traffic. This mode is ideal for modern networks, especially those with gigabit connections, as it eliminates the risk of collisions that can occur in half-duplex setups. Disabling duplex settings is not a practical option, as the duplex mode needs to be explicitly defined to ensure optimal performance and reliability of the network connection. While auto-negotiation can adaptively select the best mode, manually setting the connection to full-duplex ensures consistent performance without relying on negotiation processes, which is crucial for critical server connections. Half-duplex mode does prevent collisions by allowing data transmission in one direction at a time, but it significantly reduces the efficiency of high-volume, bidirectional data transfers."

EIGRP is proprietary to Cisco systems, which supports its implementation in a Cisco-dominated environment. One of its key characteristics is rapid convergence, facilitated by its use of a composite metric (combining bandwidth, delay, load, and reliability) for routing decisions, making it efficient and flexible for network changes. BGP is designed for use between autonomous systems on the internet, not for internal network convergence and efficiency. BGP is not proprietary to Cisco. OSPF is an open standard protocol and while it supports rapid convergence, it doesn't fit the proprietary requirement.

      "Route poisoning"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Route poisoning is a method to prevent a router from sending packets through a route that has become invalid within computer networks. This is achieved by changing the route's metric to a value that exceeds the maximum allowable hop count so that the route is advertised as unreachable. The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks and operates at layer 2 of the OSI model. The basic function of STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them. A split-horizon route advertisement is a method of preventing routing loops in distance-vector routing protocols by prohibiting a router from advertising a route back onto the interface from which it was learned. A hold down timer is a function of a router that prevents a route from being updated for a specified length of time (in seconds). A hold down timer allows for the routers in a topology to have sufficient time to reach convergence and be updated when a route fails."

Which type of DNS record should be added to fix this issue?",
    "options": [
      "PTR",
      "AAAA",
      "NS",
      "CNAME"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": [
      "CNAME"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A CNAME (Canonical Name) DNS record is a type of DNS record that maps one domain name (an alias) to another domain name (the canonical name). This is useful when multiple domain names need to point to the same server without duplicating IP address configurations."

    "question": "Which of the following type of sites would be used if your organisation plans to switch to teleworking and remote operations in the event of a disaster?",
    "options": [
      "Hot site",
      "Warm site",
      "Cloud site",
      "Cold site"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": [
      "Cloud site"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A cloud site is a virtual recovery site that allows you to create a recovery version of your organisation’s enterprise network in the cloud. Cloud sites are useful when your disaster recovery plan includes migrating to a telework or remote operations environment. A hot site is a real-time replication of an existing network environment. All data generated and stored at the primary site is immediately replicated and backed up at the disaster recovery site. A warm site is a type of facility an organisation uses to recover its technology infrastructure when its primary data centre goes down. A warm site features an equipped data centre but no customer data. A cold site is a backup facility with little or no hardware equipment installed. A cold site is essentially an office space with basic utilities such as power, cooling system, air conditioning, and communication equipment, etc."
