    "correctAnswer": "User1 and User2 only",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "-User1 and User2 only is CORRECT. When a role is assigned to a group, all users of that group will have that role by inheritance. AG1 will also send an email notification to User2 since User2 has inherited the \u2018Monitoring Reader\u2019 role through Group1 membership."

While configuring an alert rule in Azure Monitor to alert an administrator upon detecting errors logged in virtual machine called VM1's System event log, which resource should you specify as the monitoring target?",

    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": "Azure Log Analytics workspace",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "-Virtual machine extension is INCORRECT as all windows event logs are directly stored in Log Analytics workspace. We cannot fetch these logs using the VM extension.  \n\n-Virtual Machine is INCORRECT as this target is usually used when we need to configure performance metrics like CPU, memory, disk , network etc. But it cannot be used for event logs.  \n\n-Metric alert is INCORRECT as we need to configure this alert with a target and another metric alert cannot be used here in this case.  \n\n-Azure Log Analytics workspace is CORRECT as all windows events logs are stored in Log Analytics workspace and we would need to run this alert against a log analytics query looking for specifically System events of error category."

    "correctAnswer": "Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and shared access signatures (SAS) only",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "-Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and shared access signatures (SAS) only is CORRECT as you can use a couple of methods to authenticate yourself while moving files using AzCopy. First option is using azcopy login method which asks you to provide your Azure AD credentials and second method is to use Shared Access Signature (SAS) in the copy command itself."

    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": "Shared access signatures (SAS) only",

    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": "AzureBastionSubnet",

    "question": "Within your Azure subscription, there are various storage accounts depicted in the below table. To use AzCopy for transferring a blob directly from container1 to share1, which authentication method should be employed specifically for \"storage1\"?",

      "OAuth",
      "Anonymous",
      "A storage account access key",

    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": "A shared access signature (SAS) token",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "-OAuth is INCORRECT as the source URL for a Blob copy needs to have a SAS token appended to it. OAuth can be used in the destination URL for a blob container. Hence it cannot be used here.  \n\n-Anonymous is INCORRECT as the public access is configured to be \u2018no public access\u2019 on the container level. Hence we cannot access it without an authentication method.  \n\n-A Storage Account Access key is INCORRECT as it is not recommended to use a Storage Account access key when we want to move the data from a single container to a file share. Reason being, this key gives the read/write access to the entire storage account including all containers.  \n\n-A Shared Access Signature (SAS) token is CORRECT as in the scenario of copying the blob directly from a container to a file share, the source URL can only have either a SAS token or the container needs to be public. We can use either SAS token or OAuth for the destination URL in case of a blob to blob move."

    "correctAnswer": "You can create Azure SQL servers in ContosoRG1 only.",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "-You are prevented from creating Azure SQL servers anywhere in Subscription 1 is INCORRECT because the policy has an \u201cexclusion\u201d meaning that there is a resource group (ContosoRG1) in which these servers can be created.  \n\n-You can create Azure SQL servers in ContosoRG1 only is the CORRECT answer here. A \u201cpolicy exclusion\u201d allows the user to assign policy at a high level and then exclude scopes within it. Example: In an Azure Public Cloud with many applications and a central network, the user wants to have a policy for all application resource groups but not for the network resource group. The user needs to assign different policies on all application resource groups, previously. Now with the \u201cExclusion Scope\u201d, the user can assign the policy at the subscription scope, so that even new application resource groups that are created are automatically managed by this scope. In the above image the \u201cExclusions\u201d has the value of \u201cSubscription1/ConstosoRG1\u201d meaning that \u201cMicrosoft.Sql/servers\u201d can be created in ContosoRG1 only under \u201cSubscription1\u201d  \n\n-You are prevented from creating Azure SQL Servers in ContosoRG1 only is INCORRECT because as per the \u201cexclusions\u201d the user can create servers only in ContosoRG1.  \n\n-You can create Azure SQL servers in any resource group within Subscription 1 is INCORRECT because the exhibit does NOT say (\u201c*\u201d) to create the server in any resource group"

    "correctAnswer": "From contoso.com, create an OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint.",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "-From contoso.com modify the Organization relationships settings is INCORRECT because the Organization relationship settings has nothing to do with the authorization of the user here.  \n\n- From contoso.com, create an OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint is the CORRECT answer here. Kubectl uses the Microsoft Entra ID lient application to sign the users with OAuth 2.0 device authorization. Therefore, from the tenant \u201ccontoso.com\u201d we need to create an \u201cauthorization endpoint\u201d using the OAuth 2.0 device authorization (credentials)  \n\n-Recreate AKS1 is INCORRECT because there is no necessity of re-creating the AKS cluster here.  \n\n-From AKS1, create a namespace is INCORRECT because namespaces are only a logical grouping for the Kubernetes resources like \u2013 deployments and pods and this have nothing to do with the authorizations of users here."
