    "correctAnswer": ["Starting up a project"],
    "type": "single",

As such, starting up a project is a lighter process compared to the more detailed and thorough process of initiating a project. The aim is to do the minimum necessary to decide whether it is worthwhile to even initiate the project. Ref 13.1"
