      "question": "Given the recent adoption of new National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines, a company plans to adjust its policies to provide protection when circumstances prevent the use of primary security measures. Which provides this type of protection to the company?",
      "options": ["Patching", "Compensating controls", "Configuration management", "Awareness training"],
      "image": "",
      "correctAnswer": ["Compensating controls"],
      "type": "single",
      "explanation": "Many organizations use complicated and highly integrated systems that are extremely difficult to change, upgrade, and maintain. Compensating controls provide protection when circumstances prevent the use of primary security measures."

      "quizName": "CySA+ 003 Knowledge Check 7",
      "question": "Legacy system constraints prevent the modification of a financial organization's critical application. However, the application does not meet a specific security requirement outlined in the organization's security policy. Which of the following should the organization implement to address the security requirement without modifying the application?",
      "options": ["Preventative", "Detective", "Compensating", "Corrective"],
      "image": "",
      "correctAnswer": ["Compensating"],

      "question": "Despite recovering from a crypto locker virus a year ago, a small investment firm finds itself the target of a new attack. In this instance, the attacker gains access using a computer desktop scoped to be removed due to end-of-support over a year ago. What type of exposure does the firm see in this instance?",

      "image": "",
      "correctAnswer": ["Mitigation"],
      "type": "single",
      "explanation": "Detailed vulnerability reports include recommended mitigations, such as identifying a patch or describing a workaround. These mitigations from the security information and event management tool can help better secure a company's equipment."

    {
      "quizName": "CySA+ 003 Knowledge Check 7",
      "question": "A security engineer is looking to improve the security of their email system and identify vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. The system has a built-in reporting mechanism that shows what things they can do to improve overall security and suggested fixes with different percentages to show importance. What component of vulnerability reporting does this relate to?",
      "options": ["Risk score", "Prioritization", "Vulnerabilities", "Mitigation"],
      "image": "",
      "correctAnswer": ["Risk score"],
      "type": "single",
      "explanation": "The scenario describes a system that highlights potential improvements for security and assigns different percentages to show the importance of each suggested fix. These percentages indicating importance represent risk scores, which help measure the risk posed by a particular system, application, or individual vulnerability in terms of being successfully hacked or breached."
