    "quizName": "CySA+ 003 Knowledge Check 1",
    "question": "An IT director reviews a cybersecurity audit and learns that an old accounting server is significantly out of compliance. Rather than attempting repairs, the director concludes that decommissioning the server is the safest course of action. What is the risk management principle the IT director is following?",
    "options": ["Risk acceptance", "Risk mitigation", "Risk avoidance", "Risk transference"],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Risk avoidance"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The IT director is electing to follow risk avoidance because of the risk and cost of bringing the server into compliance. Risk avoidance often means that the company stops risk-bearing activity. For instance, risk managers may discover that a software application has numerous high-severity security vulnerabilities."

  {
    "quizName": "CySA+ 003 Knowledge Check 1",
    "question": "A support team is preparing for an upcoming maintenance window. What tasks should the support team accomplish during the proactive maintenance windows?",
    "options": ["Implement untested patches", "Restart devices", "Analyze events", "Restore critical services after a backup test"],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Restart devices", "Analyze events", "Restore critical services after a backup test"],
    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "Devices are often restarted during maintenance windows to apply updates, reset connections, and refresh systems. This is a standard maintenance procedure aimed at ensuring that services run optimally post-maintenance. Analyzing events during maintenance is important for identifying irregularities that could indicate problems with the maintenance activities or potential security issues. This analysis is proactive and helps in ensuring the health and security of the IT environment. Restoring critical services after a backup test can be part of a proactive maintenance strategy. This helps in confirming that backup systems are functioning correctly and that critical services can be restored in case of a failure, ensuring business continuity."
