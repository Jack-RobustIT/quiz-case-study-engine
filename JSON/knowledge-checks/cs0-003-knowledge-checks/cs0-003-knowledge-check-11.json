      "question": "An organization is experiencing issues related to high bandwidth consumption, which has led to network congestion and slower application performance. The organization needs to implement a combination of tools and techniques to help identify the causes of high bandwidth usage, monitor network traffic, and optimize bandwidth utilization. Which of the following options would be effective for addressing these issues? (Select the three best options.)",

      "type": "multiple",
      "explanation": "A network traffic analyzer can help identify the causes of high bandwidth usage by monitoring network traffic, capturing packets, and providing insights into which devices, applications, or users consume the most bandwidth. By implementing quality of service (QoS), an organization can ensure that critical applications and services receive adequate bandwidth while assigning less important traffic a lower priority. Data compression techniques can reduce the size of data transmitted over the network, thus decreasing bandwidth consumption."
