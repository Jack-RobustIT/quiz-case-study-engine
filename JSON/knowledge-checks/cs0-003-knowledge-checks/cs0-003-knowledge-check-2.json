    "quizName": "CySA+ 003 Knowledge Check 2",
    "question": "Which of the following are characteristics of an advanced persistent threat? (Select the three best options.)",
    "options": ["Remove evidence of the attack", "Target large organizations", "Spend little time gathering intelligence", "Develop highly specific exploits"],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Remove evidence of the attack", "Target large organizations", "Develop highly specific exploits"],
    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "One of the defining characteristics of an APT is anti-forensics, where the adversary removes evidence of the attack. APTs typically target large organizations such as financial institutions, companies in healthcare, and other organizations that store large volumes of personally identifiable information (PII), especially when the PII describes important government and political figures. APTs spend considerable time gathering intelligence on their targets to develop highly specific exploits. APT groups often combine many different attack elements into a carefully planned and orchestrated attack that may unfold over several months or longer."

    "explanation": "A CERT aims to mitigate cybercrime and minimize damage by responding to incidents quickly. CERTs work with local law enforcement, federal agencies, and other organizations to help prevent cyberattacks. CERTs coordinate responses to major events like natural disasters or terrorist attacks. This allows CERTs to provide knowledge and information regarding trending and observed attacks."

    "correctAnswer": ["The dark web serves as an operating platform for cybercrimes.", "Threat actors leverage the dark web for criminal activities.", "The dark web can provide evidence of previously undiscovered breaches."],
    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "The security consultant should be aware that the dark web serves as an operating platform for many cybercrimes. The consultant should also be aware that threat actors utilize the dark web to organize their efforts and sell products like credit card numbers, drugs, weapons, and malware. Observing this activity can provide insight into threat actor activities, future attacks, information regarding current tactics, and evidence of previously undiscovered breaches."

    "question": "An attacker is browsing social media accounts associated with a targeted organization. Why is the attacker using social media in this manner? (Select the three best options.)",
    "options": ["Attackers can use social media sites to find an organization's information.", "Attackers can leverage social media as a vector to launch attacks against targets.", "Attackers can use information from social media as a source of defensive OSINT.", "An attacker may find posts or user profiles that give away sensitive information."],

    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "Attackers can use social media sites like Facebook and LinkedIn to find an organization's information. Attackers can leverage social media as a vector to launch attacks against targets. An example of such a scenario would be impersonation. Attackers can impersonate trusted people to get a target to divulge information about an organization. Depending on how much an organization or an organization's employees choose to share publicly, an attacker may find posts or user profiles that give away sensitive information or simply act as another vector or target for the attacker to take advantage of."

    "quizName": "CySA+ 003 Knowledge Check 2",
    "question": "A security analyst is analyzing systems for potential misconfiguration. Misconfiguration hunting is an important focus area. What are some key items the analyst should search for while misconfiguration hunting? (Select the three best options.)",
    "options": ["Weak passwords", "Open ports", "Unpatched software", "Isolated networks"],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Weak passwords", "Open ports", "Unpatched software"],
    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "One key item to search for during misconfiguration hunting is weak passwords. An attacker can exploit weak passwords and gain control of a system. Another key item to look for while misconfiguration hunting is open ports. Open ports offer attackers potential exploits leading to system compromise. During misconfiguration hunting, it is crucial to search for unpatched software. Unpatched software is a common exploit used by cybercriminals."

    "question": "A systems administrator is searching for potential vulnerabilities in the network. Which threat-hunting focus area should the administrator examine as attackers often exploit it through connected systems or physical access?",
    "options": ["Isolated networks", "Misconfigured systems", "Business-critical assets", "Lateral movements"],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Isolated networks"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Isolated networks, such as air-gapped networks or networks with limited connectivity to the internet, are often thought to be more secure. However, attackers can still target these networks by exploiting vulnerabilities in connected systems or through physical access."

    "question": "A cybersecurity analyst wants to collect indicators of compromise (IoCs) to identify, investigate, and mitigate threats. What are some examples of IoCs that the analyst will be collecting? (Select the three best options.)",
    "options": ["Expected configuration changes", "Odd network patterns", "Unusual account behaviors", "Unfamiliar new files"],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Odd network patterns", "Unusual account behaviors", "Unfamiliar new files"],
    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "Odd network patterns are one of the many indicators of compromise (IoCs) that the cybersecurity analyst might collect. Other common forms of IoC include unusual outbound network traffic, logins occurring from unexpected geographic locations, and suspicious privileged user account behavior. Unusual account behavior is another example of an indicator of compromise (IoC) that the analyst might collect. If the analyst finds an unfamiliar new file on a system, it would also be an indicator of compromise (IoC)."

    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Search for unauthorized access attempts", "Search for unusual traffic patterns"],
    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "Business-critical asset hunting involves searching for vulnerabilities and threats that could impact these assets. For example, security analysts can search for unauthorized access attempts. Security analysts can also search for unusual traffic patterns during business-critical asset-hunting exercises."

    "options": ["Honeypots seek to redirect malicious traffic away from live production systems.", "Honeypots can provide an early warning regarding ongoing attacks.", "Honeypots help collect intelligence on the attackers and their techniques.", "Honeypots assist defensive teams in identifying and responding after an attack has taken place on critical systems."],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Honeypots seek to redirect malicious traffic away from live production systems.", "Honeypots can provide an early warning regarding ongoing attacks.", "Honeypots help collect intelligence on the attackers and their techniques."],
    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "Honeypots seek to redirect malicious traffic away from live production systems by luring attackers away from assets of actual value and/or discovering attack strategies and weaknesses in the security configuration. Honeypots can provide an early warning regarding ongoing attacks. This helps defensive teams identify and respond to attacks before they affect critical systems. Honeypots collect intelligence on attackers and the techniques they utilize. This helps administrators observe attackers and learn their strategies to better thwart them in the future."
