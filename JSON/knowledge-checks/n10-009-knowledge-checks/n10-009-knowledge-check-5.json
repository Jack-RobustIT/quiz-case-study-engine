      "A route that is automatically added for each active router interface representing subnets for which the router has a local interface"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Directly connected routes are automatically added to the routing table for each active router interface, indicating the subnets for which the router has a local interface. This ensures that the router can directly forward packets to these subnets without needing to learn these routes through other means.\n\nA route that is manually added and requires manual updates describes a static route, which is manually added to the routing table by an administrator and does not automatically update.\n\nA route for subnets and IP networks that are not directly attached to the router describes remote routes, which are for subnets and IP networks not directly attached to the router.\n\nA special type of static route that serves as the gateway of last resort describes a default route, which is a special type of static route used when an exact match for a network or host route is not found in the routing table."

    "options": [
      "IPv6 allows routers to perform fragmentation.",

      "IPv6 increases the MTU to avoid fragmentation.",

    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["IPv6 requires the host to perform path MTU discovery."],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "IPv6 designates the responsibility of discovering the path MTU to the sending host, avoiding fragmentation within the network. This approach aims to reduce the complexity and inefficiency associated with fragmentation.\n\nIPv6 specifically does not allow routers to fragment packets, shifting this responsibility to the sending host.\n\nWhile IPv6 supports a larger payload, the protocol itself does not increase the MTU but requires path MTU discovery to avoid fragmentation.\n\nIPv6 eliminates fragmentation at the router level, thus changing the approach to fragmentation management rather than using different header fields for this purpose."

    "explanation": "TTL effectively limits the number of hops a packet can make, preventing it from circulating indefinitely in the network.\n\nTTL is not measured in physical distance but in hops.\n\nWhile TTL stands for Time to Live, it is used as a hop count rather than a time limit.\n\nTTL does not indicate priority; it controls the packet's lifespan in terms of hops."

    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["By choosing the route with the lowest metric"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "When two routes have the same prefix length, the router will compare their metrics to decide which route is more efficient or has a lower cost. The route with the lower metric is preferred.\n\nPacket size does not influence route selection. Routing decisions are based on metrics and AD values.\n\nBy preferring the route with the shortest prefix is incorrect because the question already states that the routes have identical prefix lengths. Moreover, routing decisions favor longer (more specific) prefixes.\n\nAD is used to choose between routes from different routing protocols, not to compare routes with the same prefix length within the same protocol."

    "correctAnswer": [
      "If the network is connected to the internet using multiple ISPs"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Very large networks can use BGP internally, but they typically only share routes on the internet if the AS (autonomous system) has two or more connections to the internet through different ISPs.\n\nIf your network has over 15 hops, use a routing protocol other than RIP.\n\nUse OSPF or IS-IS to divide your network into areas.\n\nPrivate networks that use public IP addresses do not need to share routes with internet routers. It is typically the ISP's responsibility to configure routes on the private network, even when public addressing is being used.\n\nA single route out of the private network is all that's required if the network has a single connection to the internet."

    "correctAnswer": ["TCP"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "BGP operates over TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) on port 179. TCP provides a reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes, which is essential for the exchange of routing information between BGP peers.\n\nUDP is a connectionless protocol and does not provide the reliability that BGP requires for exchanging routing information.\n\nICMP is used for diagnostic or control purposes, not for the operation of routing protocols like BGP.\n\nARP is used for resolving network layer addresses into link layer addresses, which is unrelated to BGP's function."

    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["A flapping interface"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A flapping interface, which frequently changes its state from up to down and back again, can cause convergence problems. This is because each state change can trigger the routers to recalculate routes, leading to instability and inconsistent routing information across the network.\n\nA stable network with no changes would actually facilitate convergence, not cause problems.\n\nConsistent routing information is the goal of convergence, not a cause of its problems.\n\nStatic routing protocols do not participate in convergence; they are manually configured and do not adapt to network changes."

    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["The path with the lowest cost metric is used."],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "When multiple routes to the same destination are available, the routing protocol evaluates them based on their cost metrics. The route with the lowest cost metric is considered the most efficient and is therefore selected for use in the IP routing table. This ensures optimal use of network resources and efficient data transmission.\n\nSelecting the route with the highest cost metric would lead to less efficient data transmission, which contradicts the goal of dynamic routing protocols to find the best path.\n\nRouting decisions are not made randomly. They are based on specific criteria such as the cost metric to ensure the most efficient path is chosen.\n\nWhile some routing protocols can support load balancing across multiple paths, the question specifically refers to the selection process when multiple routes are available. The primary criterion for selection is the cost metric, not load balancing."

The traffic is inherently part of that VLAN.\n\nTagged ports add a VLAN tag only when necessary, such as when forwarding traffic over a trunk link.\n\nUntagged ports are designed for a single VLAN, not multiple VLANs.\n\nTagged ports do not strip VLAN tags from incoming frames; they forward frames with the tags to appropriate VLANs."

    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Trunking is used to connect multiple network switches together, allowing for the creation of a larger network infrastructure. This is essential in environments where a single switch cannot provide enough ports to connect all devices, thereby necessitating the use of multiple switches to form a cohesive network fabric.\n\nConnecting a computer to the internet is a function of routers and modems, not trunking. Trunking specifically refers to the practice of linking switches to expand the network.\n\nTrunking does not specifically aim to replace wireless connections; it is a method used in wired networks to interconnect switches. Both wired and wireless connections have their own applications and are used based on different criteria.\n\nWhile trunking can contribute to network security by segregating traffic into VLANs, its primary purpose is not security but rather the expansion and interconnection of the network infrastructure."

      "It advertises a route with a hop count of 16 to indicate the network is unreachable."
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A poison route is advertised with a hop count set to the maximum (e.g., 16 in RIP) to explicitly notify other routers that the network is unreachable, helping to prevent routing loops.\n\nIncreasing the hop count to the maximum does not speed up convergence; it indicates unreachability.\n\nA hop count of 16 indicates unreachability, not reachability.\n\nDecreasing the hop count to zero would indicate a directly connected network, not related to poison routes."
