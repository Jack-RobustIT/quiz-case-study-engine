    "question": "When referencing network topologies what distinguishes half-duplex from full-duplex communication in a point-to-point link?",
    "options": [
      "Half-duplex allows for data transmission in both directions but not simultaneously; full-duplex permits simultaneous two-way data transmission.",
      "Half-duplex communication can only occur in one direction while full-duplex allows for data transmission in both directions but not at the same time.",
      "Full-duplex communication is limited to one direction at a time similar to half-duplex but it operates at higher speeds.",
      "Half-duplex communication uses a single cable for data transmission whereas full-duplex requires separate cables for each direction."
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Half-duplex allows for data transmission in both directions but not simultaneously; full-duplex permits simultaneous two-way data transmission."],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Half-duplex communication can only occur in one direction while full-duplex allows for data transmission in both directions but not at the same time is incorrect. It inaccurately states that half-duplex communication can only occur in one direction. Half-duplex does allow for two-way communication but with the limitation that it cannot happen simultaneously.\n\nFull-duplex communication is limited to one direction at a time similar to half-duplex but it operates at higher speeds is incorrect. It confuses the capabilities of full-duplex communication. Full-duplex systems can indeed transmit data in both directions simultaneously not just one direction at a time. The speed of the communication is not the defining difference between half-duplex and full-duplex.\n\nHalf-duplex communication uses a single cable for data transmission whereas full-duplex requires separate cables for each direction is incorrect. It suggests that the use of separate cables is what differentiates half-duplex from full-duplex communication. The distinction between half-duplex and full-duplex is not about the number of cables used but about whether data transmission can occur simultaneously in both directions."

An SME network is designed to support dozens of users and would use structured cabling and multiple switches and routers to provide connectivity. This is the most suitable type of network for a company with 50 employees.\n\nSmall Office/Home Office (SOHO) networks are typically designed for smaller setups often using a single Internet router/switch/access point to provide connectivity.

This is not the case for a company with a single office.\n\nA data center is a network that hosts only servers and storage not end user client devices. In this scenario the office has end user client devices (the employees' workstations) so a data center would not be appropriate."

    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["To add additional data headers for routing and delivery"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Data encapsulation is a fundamental process in network communication where data at each layer of the OSI model is wrapped with protocol-specific headers (and sometimes footers). These headers provide essential information such as source and destination addresses error checking and more which are necessary for the correct routing and delivery of data across a network. This process ensures that data packets are handled appropriately at each hop along their path to the destination.\n\nEncapsulation is not about compressing data but organizing it for transmission. Compression is a separate process that might be applied to data before encapsulation.\n\nEncapsulation itself does not involve encryption. Encryption may be applied to data as part of the security protocols at various layers but is distinct from the encapsulation process.\n\nEncapsulation deals with the digital organization of data for transmission not the conversion of digital signals to analog. The conversion to analog signals if necessary is handled at the Physical layer separate from the encapsulation process."

    "explanation": "The following are the functions that a SOHO router implements:\nEthernet switch. The RJ-45 jacks on a SOHO router are connected internally by an Ethernet switch allowing multiple wired devices to communicate within the same network segment. This is a key function at layer 2 facilitating the use of Physical layer adapters for wired connections.\n\nWireless access point. A SOHO router includes a wireless access point which uses radio antennas to implement a version of the Wi-Fi standard. This allows wireless devices such as PCs tablets smartphones and printers to form a network. The access point is also connected to the Ethernet switch internally bridging the wired and wireless segments into a single logical data link network.\n\nWhile a DHCP server is a common feature in SOHO routers it operates at a higher layer (Layer 3 - Network Layer) by assigning IP addresses to devices on the network. It is not a function implemented at Layer 2 which deals with physical addressing and access to the media.\n\nA firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls operate at Layer 3 (Network Layer) and above making decisions based on IP addresses and other higher-layer protocols not at Layer 2.\n\nNAT is a method used to remap one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Ensuring that the workstation's firewall settings are not blocking internet access involves checking the Transport Layer (Layer 4) which is important for managing end-to-end communication and error checking. However it's recommended to start troubleshooting from the Physical Layer (Layer 1) and work your way up through the OSI model. Checking the firewall settings at this early stage might miss physical or network configuration issues that are preventing internet access.\n\nWhen employing the bottom-to-top OSI model approach for troubleshooting the first step is to start at the lowest layer (Layer 1 Physical Layer) and work your way up. Since the issue is isolated to a single workstation it's logical to first check the physical connections such as the Ethernet cable and NIC for any signs of damage or disconnection. Physical connectivity problems are common and can prevent a device from accessing the network.\n\nVerifying that the web browser settings on the workstation are correctly configured focuses on the Application Layer (Layer 7) which is the top layer of the OSI model. While it's important to ensure that the web browser settings are correct this should be considered later in the troubleshooting process especially since the issue might be related to lower layers of the OSI model such as physical connectivity or IP configuration.\n\nVerifying IP address configuration is crucial but it belongs to Layer 3 (Network Layer) of the OSI model. This step should be performed after ensuring that the physical connections (Layer 1) and data link layer (Layer 2) components such as switches are functioning correctly. Jumping directly to Layer 3 might overlook simpler issues that could be resolved at the lower layers."

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The divide and conquer approach involves starting the troubleshooting process at the layer of the OSI model that is most likely to be the source of the problem based on the symptoms and any preliminary information gathered. This approach allows for a more targeted and efficient troubleshooting process as it narrows down the focus to the most probable cause of the issue. Once the starting layer is identified the troubleshooter can work either up or down the OSI model depending on the results of their tests and observations to isolate and resolve the problem.\n\nStarting the troubleshooting process at the Physical Layer (Layer 1) and sequentially checking each layer until the Application Layer (Layer 7) is reached refers to a top-down or bottom-up approach not the divide and conquer approach. These methods involve systematically checking each layer in sequence either from the bottom layer up or the top layer down rather than focusing on the most likely source of the problem first.\n\nFocusing solely on the Application Layer (Layer 7) to identify and resolve any software-related issues before considering network infrastructure problems incorrectly suggests that troubleshooting should always begin at the Application Layer (Layer 7) regardless of the symptoms or nature of the issue. It does not reflect the flexibility and targeted nature of the divide and conquer approach which considers all layers based on the symptoms and information available.\n\nChecking all layers of the OSI model simultaneously to quickly identify and resolve network issues without considering the logical order of the layers is not practical or efficient as it suggests an unstructured attempt to troubleshoot all layers at once without prioritizing based on the most likely causes. The divide and conquer approach by contrast focuses on isolating the problem to a specific layer based on logical deduction and evidence rather than attempting to address all layers simultaneously."
