    "correctAnswer": [
      "Use network segmentation to isolate and monitor infected systems to analyze the attacker’s tactics"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Network segmentation is necessary to prevent malware from spreading and monitor its activity closely. Network segmentation creates a controlled environment that does not alert the attacker that the CIRT is observing their actions. Disconnecting all affected hosts from the network or shutting down communication channels is not recommended since it hinders the CIRT's ability to collect valuable information about the attacker's activities and tactics. Restoring affected systems from backups or applying patches without proper analysis and understanding of the attack can lead to the same exploited vulnerabilities.\n\n It is essential to strategically disable user accounts and applications based on the attacker's threat level instead of a blanket approach. However disabling all accounts could disrupt business operations."

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Threat hunting proactively searches for threat activity within a network or system rather than waiting for alerts from security tools. Organizations can detect and mitigate threats by actively seeking out potential threats before they cause significant damage. Threat hunting does not respond to incidents that have already occurred. Instead it aims to identify potential threats before they escalate into full-blown security incidents. Hardening systems and creating incident response resources are components of the incident response preparation phase. Threat hunting is a proactive activity to identify existing threats within the network. Recovering systems and restoring data from backup is part of the incident response recovery phase. Threat hunting focuses on the proactive detection of threat actor activity rather than recovery efforts."

It allows organizations to take preemptive actions to prevent security incidents and breaches. Threat hunting is a proactive approach that involves searching for potential threats before they trigger alerts. It does not rely solely on reactive responses to incident management system alerts. Isolating affected systems from the network is a containment strategy within the incident response process not the primary goal of threat hunting. Threat hunting discovers potential threats before they spread. While outsourcing incident response is an option it is not the primary goal of threat hunting.

It ensures the CIRT properly addresses the incident while minimizing damage and potential recurrence. This sequence includes isolation as a step which is not part of the CompTIA incident response lifecycle. Additionally isolation is often a containment technique rather than a standalone step. While detection and analysis are present the sequence of subsequent steps is incorrect. Eradication should come after containment and restoration is not part of the typical process. Isolation is not part of the CompTIA incident response lifecycle steps. Restoration is not a distinct step while improvement is not typically a separate phase in the incident response lifecycle."

Network-based vulnerability scanners focus on identifying vulnerabilities in network devices and systems but they do not provide summarized views of diverse data sources for incident response tasks. Although logs created by applications on hosts are sources of data they are not typically for providing condensed overviews for daily incident response duties. Host-based intrusion detection systems monitor activities on a single host. They can generate alerts but are not for aggregating and correlating data from diverse sources for summarized views."

    "question": "Which tool or concept can provide a unified view of network hosts and appliances by collecting and aggregating log data from multiple sources offering better visibility into security events?",
    "options": [
      "Event Viewer format logging",
      "Syslog protocol",
      "Event metadata analysis",
      "Single pane of glass analysis"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Single pane of glass analysis"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Using Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) software organizations can analyze data from different sources in one place also known as a 'single pane of glass.' SIEM allows for a comprehensive view of network devices and improves the ability to detect and respond to security incidents. Event Viewer format logging is specific to Windows hosts and applications focusing on logging event data but it does not offer the unified view provided by SIEM software. The syslog protocol logs event messages from different host types but it does not offer the comprehensive view that SIEM software provides. Analyzing event metadata is useful for investigating log data but does not provide a complete view of network hosts and appliances."

    "question": "When it comes to monitoring network security which logs help detect any attempts made by a threat actor to attack a wireless network through disassociation events?",
    "options": [
      "System logs from routers",
      "Access logs from switches",
      "Firewall audit logs",
      "Access point logs"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Access point logs"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Access point logs record network behavior related to wireless access. In this scenario disassociation events recorded in access point logs can indicate a threat actor attempting to attack the wireless network. System logs from routers focus on the operation and status of the router itself not specifically on recording events related to wireless network attacks. Switch access logs usually pertain to network traffic and may not directly record wireless network occurrences such as disassociation events. Firewall audit logs provide information about firewall rule triggers incoming/outgoing traffic and whether packets get accepted or dropped. They are not explicitly related to wireless network disassociation events."

    "question": "Which type of analysis involves deep-down frame-by-frame scrutiny of captured network traffic to decode packet header fields and payload contents aiding in identifying attack tools data exfiltration attempts and suspicious domains?",
    "options": [
      "Retrospective network analysis",
      "Protocol-level summarization",
      "Security information and event management packet aggregation",
      "Sensor-based traffic recording"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Retrospective network analysis"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Retrospective network analysis (RNA) involves recording the totality of network events at a packet header or payload level. It allows detailed analysis of captured traffic to identify attack tools data exfiltration attempts and suspicious domains. Protocol-level summarization involves aggregating and summarizing information from network packets to show overall protocol usage and endpoint activity. It does not involve deep packet analysis. Security information and event management (SIEM) packet aggregation involves storing selected information from sensors at different network points. While SIEMs can provide the ability to pivot to the underlying packets they do not perform deep-down packet analysis. Sensor-based traffic recording involves recording packets triggered by specific firewall or IDS rules. It is a part of network monitoring but does not refer to deep packet analysis."

    "question": "What kind of metadata is usually linked with files and includes information like creation date access history and security permissions?",
    "options": [
      "Web metadata",
      "Email header metadata",
      "Social media metadata",
      "File metadata"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["File metadata"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "File metadata encompasses attributes such as creation date access history modification details security permissions and extended attributes offering insights into files stored on a system. Web metadata involves headers exchanged between web clients and servers encompassing details about the requested resource data type and authorization. It does not directly correlate with file attributes like creation date and security permissions. Email header metadata comprises sender and recipient address details and information about servers engaged in email transmission. It pertains to email communication and does not relate to file attributes. Social media metadata can encompass details such as the location and time when a user has uploaded media like photos and videos. This metadata correlates with content uploaded to social media platforms."

    "question": "An analyst receives an overwhelming number of low-priority alerts that could potentially lead the analyst to disregard a critical high-impact alert. \n\n What may be occurring in this situation?",
    "options": [
      "Alert tuning",
      "Alert fatigue",
      "Threat hunting",
      "False positive"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Alert fatigue"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Analysts experience alert fatigue when inundated with multiple low-priority alerts. These can lead to overlooking a critical high-impact alert that could have averted a data breach. Unfortunately this phenomenon can diminish the overall effectiveness of the alerting system. Alert tuning entails refining detection rules and adjusting alert parameters to enhance precision and reduce occurrences of false positives. Threat hunting involves actively searching for potential threats and indicators of compromise within an organization's network. However this concept does not directly relate to this scenario. A false positive occurs when an alert misidentifies benign activity as malicious differing from when the analyst misses important alerts due to the abundance of low-priority ones."

    "options": [
      "Vulnerability scanner",
      "System monitor",
      "Application monitor",
      "Data loss prevention (DLP) tool"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Application monitor"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "An application monitor assesses an application's health performance and functionality ensuring its smooth operation and detecting any potential issues. A vulnerability scanner identifies and reports unmitigated vulnerabilities on hosts aiding in the assessment of system security status. However its primary focus is not evaluating application health or cloud services. While a system monitor also monitors the health and performance of computer hosts it usually does not evaluate cloud services or application health as an application monitor does. A DLP tool limits the copying of tagged data to authorized media and services primarily focusing on data protection rather than assessing application health or cloud services."
