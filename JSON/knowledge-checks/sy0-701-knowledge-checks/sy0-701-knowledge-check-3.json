    "question": "A sole proprietorship construction company contacted an information technology (IT) consultant for technical support for a computer issue. After resolving that issue the consultant suggested the construction company enable computer encryption. \n\n  Why might the company want to enable encryption on its computers' hard drives?",

      "To prevent unauthorized access to data on a stolen device"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Enabling hard drive encryption is a basic step to prevent data loss in the event of a stolen device. Without it, anyone can easily access the stolen device regardless of needing a password. \n\n The purpose of hard drive encryption is to prevent data loss in the event of a stolen device. However, as technology improves, malicious actors can exploit weaknesses in encryption. \n\n Hard drive encryption does not prevent phishing. However, malicious actors could use information from an unencrypted hard drive to phish other people. \n\n Hard drive encryption may dissuade theft, but it will not prevent theft. A malicious actor can still wipe a hard drive to reuse it."

    "question": "A cancer diagnostic clinic must transfer a large amount of data to a cloud vendor to migrate from its on-premises server. However the amount of data would make the transfer over the internet take extensive time due to the limited bandwidth the clinic’s internet provides. \n\n  Instead it wants to ship an encrypted copy of the data to the vendor.

Only authorized persons should know or have the secret key. \n\n An asymmetric algorithm performs both encryption and decryption but with two different but related public and private keys in a key pair. \n\n Plaintext refers to data that is not encrypted. Anyone can easily intercept data that is in plaintext form. \n\n Cryptography is the art of making information secure by encoding it.

A hashing algorithm is also useful for proving integrity. \n\n Hashing does not speed up the encryption process. However, any slowness it introduces is negligible with modern computers. \n\n Hashing does slow down the encryption process, but it is negligible with modern computers. The slowing down during the encryption process would not be a primary concern. \n\n Hashing does not create ciphertext of varying lengths. Instead, it makes ciphertext the same length regardless of the input length."

    "correctAnswer": ["Encryption allows for confidentiality."],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The purpose of encryption is to allow for confidentiality. It prevents third parties from listening in and knowing what communication is occurring. Encryption is important for things like whistleblower reporting. \n\n While putting in an effort to get information for a story may help show the anonymous sender that the reporter has an interest, it would not be the primary concern. \n\n Anyone sending confidential data may be suspicious of those around them, but it would not be the reason to use encryption. \n\n Encryption does not prevent theft of intellectual property per se although it may prevent access to that intellectual property. However, the theft can still occur albeit in encrypted form."

Furthermore, adding salting and hashing will greatly reduce the chances of malicious actors gaining access to the data. \n\n Increasing the key length of an algorithm does not improve performance. However, it will help to improve security. \n\n Increasing the complexity and key length of an algorithm will slow down encryption. However, slowing down encryption is mostly negligible with modern computing. \n\n Improving the overall security of an encryption algorithm does not increase the chance of cracking the ciphertext. The intention is to make it much less feasible."
