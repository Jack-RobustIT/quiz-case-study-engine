    "explanation": "With the number of passwords people must remember and the various complexity requirements, people typically choose passwords that threat actors can easily crack and unfortunately reuse them across multiple services. \n\n Contrary to always being secure, passwords conceptually are not insecure, but how companies store passwords and end-user password practices can make them insecure. \n\n Passwords may be the bane of the technology era, but they are necessary to secure systems and services. There are alternatives but they are not yet commonplace. \n\n Employees commonly choose the easiest password that fits requirements, which would suggest needing a second factor to increase security."

    "explanation": "With the number of passwords people must remember and the various complexity requirements, people typically choose passwords that threat actors can easily crack and unfortunately reuse them across multiple services. \n\n With the increasing complexity and short password age policies, it is common for people to write their passwords down in insecure ways such as sticky notes or unencrypted files on their computers. \n\n Password age policies create a sense of false security, pushing people to make poor password choices through slight modifications to previous passwords. \n\n Employees must closely follow password age policies as the system forces them to do it, leading them to make weaker passwords."

    "correctAnswer": ["Password complexity"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Modifying the password complexity policy to allow for longer but easily remembered passwords can aid in lowering the number of people saving their passwords insecurely. \n\n A password reuse policy would be difficult to enforce as it requires the individual not to use it for other services, even those not connected to the company. \n\n Password history policies could help limit the insecure use and reuse of passwords. However, decreasing the complexity would allow for new passwords that are easy to remember. \n\n Password management would not necessarily prevent the insecure storage of passwords. It would require employees to use the management system consistently."

    "explanation": "Location-based access policies would need a temporary exemption option to allow for travel. Location-based access policies prevent access to company systems outside a specified area (typically the company's state). \n\n Password management would not aid in accessing a system set up to prevent access outside specific locations. However, it would provide a better way for employees to save passwords securely. \n\n Password age would not help resolve issues accessing corporate resources from outside specific approved locations. \n\n Multifactor authentication should be the standard for corporate system access.

    "explanation": "Multifactor authentication has taken place as the recommendation by NIST, coupled with decreasing complexity and age requirements. Additionally, it adds another layer to prevent malicious actors from gaining access. \n\n The National Institute of Standards and Technology's updated guidelines do not change password reuse recommendations. The organization recommends people refrain from using passwords across multiple systems or services. \n\n The NIST updated guidelines do not recommend the continued use of single-factor authentication. Instead, it recommends using second-factor authentication. \n\n Password history is less of an issue if password complexity and age requirements change and companies add multifactor authentication."
