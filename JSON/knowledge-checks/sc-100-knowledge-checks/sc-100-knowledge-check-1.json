    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Never trust, always verify every access request"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Zero Trust shifts from the traditional perimeter-based model to the principle of 'never trust, always verify'.\n\nThis means every access request is verified regardless of its origin."
