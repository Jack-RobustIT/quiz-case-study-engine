    "correctAnswer": ["INNER"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "An INNER JOIN returns only rows where there is a match in both tables. Since we want to exclude employees who have not taken sales orders, INNER JOIN is the correct type."

    "correctAnswer": ["CROSS JOIN"],

    "explanation": "A CROSS JOIN produces a Cartesian product of both tables, meaning every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table. This results in every combination of product and category name."
