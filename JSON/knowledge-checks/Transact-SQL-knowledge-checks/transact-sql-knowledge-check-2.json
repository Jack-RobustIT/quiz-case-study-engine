    "question": "You write a Transact-SQL query to list the available sizes for products. Each individual size should be listed only once. Which query should you use?",
    "options": [
      "SELECT Size FROM Production.Product;",

    "question": "You must return the InvoiceNo and TotalDue columns from the Sales.Invoice table in decreasing order of TotalDue value. Which query should you use?",
    "options": [
      "SELECT * FROM Sales.Invoice ORDER BY TotalDue InvoiceNo;",

    "explanation": "To sort data in descending order by TotalDue, you use the ORDER BY clause with DESC after the column name. The correct query also selects both the InvoiceNo and TotalDue columns."
