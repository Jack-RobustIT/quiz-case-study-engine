    "question": "Your company has serval departments. Each department has a number of virtual machines (VMs).\n\nThe company has an Azure subscription that contains a resource group named RG1.\n\nAll VMs are located in RG1.\n\nYou want to associate each VM with its respective department.\n\nWhat should you do?",
    "options": [
      "Create Azure Management Groups for each department",
      "Create a resource group for each department",
      "Assign tags to the virtual machines",
      "Modify the settings of the virtual machines"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": "Assign tags to the virtual machines",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Tags are the correct method to associate metadata, such as department names, to resources like VMs without changing their location or structure.\n\nThis allows you to categorise and manage resources efficiently without needing to move them to new resource groups or modify their configurations."
