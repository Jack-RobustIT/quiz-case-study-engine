    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Regression analysis can be used to estimate these relationships. Vehicle sales represent the dependent variable and upholstery design and vehicle color are independent variables. \n\nRegression analysis is a statistical method used to estimate relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. \n\nSimple linear regression is used to study the relationship between one dependent variable and one predictor, or independent variable. This analysis informs an analyst on which predictor may have the largest impact. \n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) are measurements or goals used to identify if a business is achieving its objectives. \n\nScope creep is the adjustment of the outline of a project and its measurable tasks that are needed to meet the desired end state."
