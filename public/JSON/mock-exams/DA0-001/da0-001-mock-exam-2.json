      "An Intermediate Append",
      "Transpose Data",
      "An Inline Append",
      "Reduce Data"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["An Inline Append"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Walter should do an inline append.\n\nAn inline append will combine all selected data sets, leaving just the combined set.\n\nAn intermediate append will retain the separate data sets and also create a new data set with all the combined data.\n\nTransposing data reverses its direction, so columns become rows and rows become columns.\n\nData reduction reduces the overall volume of data in a data set."

    "correctAnswer": ["System Functions"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Sasha should use a system function to automate page numbers and the refresh date.\n\nSystem functions track report-related information which removes the need for an analyst to manually add information on page numbers, refresh dates, report names, etc.\n\nLogical functions check if a condition is met.\n\nMerge fields functions combine fields.\n\nText functions manipulate data in text-based fields."
