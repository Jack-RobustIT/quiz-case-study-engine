There are two important variables when conducting a t-test: the dependent variable, which is what is being measured, and the independent variable which is different between the groups. The dependent variable is the main data point and is used to determine the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation. A population is a group of records that meet a certain criterion."

The value of significance is referenced by the probability value. An r value is the correlation coefficient. An r value that is close to 1 indicates that there is a strong correlation between dependent and independent variables, while an R-value of or close to 0 means there is no correlation. N count is the amount of data being used in research. For example, a poll of 100 students would have an n count of 100."

Gap analysis is the study of developing projects to move from a present state to the desired state. Link analysis determines how a single data point links to other data points and focuses on relationships and connections in a database. Exploratory analysis should be done on each data set that an analyst encounters.

    "explanation": "Non-printable characters are characters that do not produce a written symbol such as a tab or space. \n\nASCII is the acronym for the American Standard Code Information Exchange, a modern standard for electronic communication. Trailing spaces are invisible characters at the back of a field. Leading spaces are invisible characters at the front of a field. Masking hides the original value of data by showing something else in its place."

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "This is an example of aggregated data. \n\nAggregated data is data that has already been gathered and analyzed for analysis and reporting. An example of this could be nonprofit polling citizens in their country on tobacco use and then making the data available to the public after it is analyzed. Public data is information that has been made available to the public through legal requirements. University research and data acquisition are not terms on the Data+ exam."

    "correctAnswer": ["Masking"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "This is an example of data masking. \n\nData masking hides the value of a field to protect sensitive data. An index field creates a unique ID for a record to not disclose its value. Appending combines data from separate data sets. Transposing data reverses its direction, so columns become rows and rows become columns."

    "options": ["Parsing", "Indexing", "Aggregate Functions", "Date Functions"],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Parsing"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Parsing breaks data apart for use. \n\nIndexing is a field property setting that improves query speed and performance for fields that are commonly queried, sorted, or filtered. Aggregate functions are written for a group of records, not just for a single record, and work with a column of data. Date functions derive attributes from date fields, like determining the day of the week, the month, or the year from a single date."

    "correctAnswer": ["An Intermediate Append", "An Inline Append"],
    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "An analyst can perform both an intermediate and inline append. \n\nAn intermediate append retains the separate data sets and also creates a new combined one. An inline append merges selected data sets directly. Transposing switches rows and columns. Reduction lowers data volume."
