    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Access control vestibules can ensure that each individual's entry into the datacenter is separately recorded by a card reader, even when multiple employees enter the facility at the same time. Access control vestibules are small rooms with two doors that require authorized individuals to present their access cards to enter or exit. The vestibules ensure that only authorized individuals enter the datacenter, and their entry is individually recorded by the card reader. Once the first door is closed, the employee must present their card again to enter the second door. This double-entry system ensures that access to the datacenter is controlled and recorded accurately."

    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["TTL"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "TTL (Time to Live) should be adjusted to address the issue. The TTL determines the amount of time a record remains cached on a DNS server before it is considered expired and must be retrieved again. If the TTL is set too low, it can result in visitors being unable to access the website because they are accessing a cached, outdated version of the DNS record."

It is capable of carrying high-frequency signals over long distances and it has a thicker insulation and shielding than other types of coaxial cable. This makes it less susceptible to interference from other sources and better able to maintain signal quality over long distances. Multimode is used for short distance communications and it's not suitable for long distance, Cat 5e and cat 6 is used for Ethernet networks. 100BASE-T is a type of Ethernet standard that uses twisted-pair cables and is typically used for short-distance"
