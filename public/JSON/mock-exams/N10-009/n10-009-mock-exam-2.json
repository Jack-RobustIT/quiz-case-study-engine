      "Granular trap"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) uses ports 161 and 162, and it is a networking protocol used for the management and monitoring of network-connected devices in Internet Protocol networks. A trap is an asynchronous notification from the agent to the manager. A trap is sent by the agent to notify the management of a significant event that is occurring in real-time, such as an alarming condition. A granular trap contains a unique object identifier (OID) number and a value for that OID. A verbose trap may contain all the information about a given alert or event as its payload. A verbose trap contains more information and data than a granular trap, and therefore requires more bandwidth to send the verbose trap over the network.\n\nA unique objective identifier (OID) identifies a variable that can be read or set using the SNMP protocol. The management information base (MIB) is a translation file that is used to describe the structure of the management data of a device subsystem using a hierarchical namespace containing object identifiers (OID)."

    "options": [
      "The firewall's MAC address has not been added to the switch's MAC address table.",
      "The firewall is not compatible with the switch's current operating system version.",

    "correctAnswer": [
      "The port connecting the firewall to the switch is still administratively down."
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "If a port was manually disabled by the engineer and not re-enabled after the installation, it would remain in an 'administratively down' state, preventing any device connected to it, including the new firewall, from joining the network. Compatibility issues between the firewall and the switch's operating system might cause configuration or management issues but would not prevent the physical connection from being established. Ports can become error disabled due to excessive CRC errors, but this would not be the case if the port had been manually disabled for maintenance or upgrade purposes and not re-enabled. While the switch's MAC address table is essential for directing traffic, the initial connection and link light activation do not require a pre-existing MAC address entry for the device."

    "question": "You are working as part of a network installation team. Your team has been asked to install Cat 5e cabling to some new offices on the building's second floor. Currently, the office only has one network closet, which is located on the first floor. Your team spent the morning running 24 new Cat 5e cables from a patch panel in the networking closet on the first floor to a new networking closet you are outfitting on the second floor. Your team terminated these cables in a new patch panel in the 2nd-floor closet. You measured the distance from the switch in the 1st-floor closet to the new 2nd-floor patch panel and determined it was 80 meters. The team then ran cables from this patch panel to each of the new offices. Some of the offices are working properly, but others are not. You suspect that some of the cable runs are exceeding the maximum length allowed by Cat 5e cabling. What is the BEST solution to this problem?",
    "options": [
      "Install a repeater between the patch panel and each office",
      "Install a hub in the second-floor networking closet to increase the signal",

    "correctAnswer": [
      "Install a switch in the second-floor networking closet to increase the signal"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The best option is to install a switch in the networking closet on the second floor, connecting to the cables coming from the first-floor closet and then to the cables on the second-floor patch panel. This will act as a repeater to boost the signal strength over the Cat 5e cable, effectively resetting the cable length to 0 meters before leaving the closet. While a repeater may be a good option, a switch is more effective in this case since there are so many cables, and repeaters usually only work for an individual cable. A hub would similarly work but would introduce a signal collision domain for all 24 computers. This would drastically decrease the performance of the network. Finally, we don't want to include a switch in each office, as this is a bad security practice and an inefficient use of resources. It is easier to manage and administer a single, centralised switch in the network closet."

The network technician has determined the adjacent office building is connected to the main office building via an 802.11ac bridge. The network technician logs into the AP and confirms the SSID, encryption, and channels are all correct. Which of the following is MOST likely the cause of this issue?",
    "options": [
      "DHCP exhaustion",
      "Bandwidth saturation",
      "Signal attenuation",
      "Incorrect antenna type"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": [
      "Signal attenuation"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The most likely reason is signal attenuation from the new flag being placed between the signal path which may be obstructing the line-of-sight between the antennas. Based on where the flag is precisely located, it is possible to only block the signal when the wind is blowing in a certain direction. This would lead to the intermittent connectivity experienced by the users caused by the signal attenuation when the flag is blocking the communication path between the antennas. DHCP exhaustion occurs when the DHCP server runs out of available IP addresses and stops issuing DHCP bindings. If DHCP exhaustion occurred, the users would not have received an IP address and they would have no connectivity instead of intermittent connectivity. The question does not mention anything about the antennas being moved or replaced recently, so it is unlikely to be an issue with the antennas since they worked previously with the same wireless network and distance. Bandwidth saturation occurs if too many devices are on one WAN link, but nothing in the question indicates that more users have been added and causing an issue."

The technician has cleaned the fiber connectors and used a fiber light meter to confirm that light passes in both directions without excessive loss. Which of the following is MOST likely the cause of this issue?",
    "options": [
      "The cable is subject to cross-talk",
      "There is a wavelength mismatch",
      "The connection is suffering from EMI",
      "The bend radius has been exceeded"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": [
      "There is a wavelength mismatch"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Wavelength mismatch occurs when two different transceivers are used at each end of the cable. For example, if one SFP uses a 1310 nm transceiver and the other end uses an 850 nm transceiver, they will be unable to communicate properly and the link will remain down. Cross-talk and EMI do not affect fiber optic cables. Electromagnetic interference (EMI) occurs when electrical signals from the local environment outside of the binder are picked up by the copper pairs in a cable and introduce noise. Crosstalk occurs when a signal transmitted on one copper twisted pair in a bundle radiates and potentially interferes with and degrades the transmission on another pair. The bend radius is how sharply a cable can safely bend without causing damage by creating micro cracks on the glass fibers."

Weak signal strength can be due to various factors, including incorrect transceiver type, degraded signal quality, or improperly terminated connections. Electromagnetic interference (EMI) does not affect fiber optic cables as they transmit light, not electrical signals. Increasing the bandwidth allocation on the switch ports does not address packet loss or latency due to signal quality issues on a fiber link. Confirming the subnet masks is important for proper IP networking but does not address the physical or signal-level issues causing packet loss and latency on a fiber optic link."

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The significant spike in network traffic during peak hours and the resultant slow internet speeds indicate congestion as the most likely cause. While faulty routers could cause connectivity issues, the described scenario of sluggish internet speeds during peak hours suggests a broader network issue rather than localised router malfunctions. Outdated network protocols could impact compatibility but wouldn't directly cause the widespread slowdowns observed during peak hours. A DNS server overload could lead to difficulties in resolving domain names, but it wouldn't directly cause the widespread slowdowns experienced by students due to congestion during peak hours."

    "explanation": "Many companies block ICMP at the firewall, causing ping to fail since it relies on ICMP. If the user can access the site in the web browser but cannot when using ping, then ICMP is most likely being blocked by the firewall. Jumbo frames are any frames larger than 1500 bytes, which is the default MTU size on most networks. VLANs are logical segments of the local area network. TACACS+ is used for remote authentication."

    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": [
      "Default route is missing/misconfigured"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The default route (0.0.0.0/0) is used to direct any traffic to destinations not known by the routing table to a default gateway, typically towards the internet. If the default route is missing in the routing table, devices in the new subnet would not be able to access the internet. DHCP misconfigurations can cause issues with devices obtaining IP addresses, but it would not specifically prevent internet access for an entire subnet if the devices already have valid IP addresses. Duplicate IP addresses can cause conflicts within a subnet but would not typically result in the entire subnet being unable to access the internet. ACLs can restrict internet access; however, the scenario implies a network change related to routing, making the absence of a default route a more likely cause."

    "question": "When installing a network cable with multiple strands, a network technician pulled the cable past a sharp edge. This resulted in the copper conductors on several of the wire strands being exposed. If these exposed conductors come into contact with each other, they can form an electrical connection. Which of the following conditions would result in this scenario?",
    "options": [
      "Crosstalk",
      "Short",
      "Electrostatic discharge",

    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": [
      "Short"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A short is an electrical term that is an abbreviation for a short circuit. A short generally means that an unintended connection between two points is allowing current to flow where it should not. In this scenario, the short is caused by the damaged cable in which two or more of the conductors are connected. This has caused the cable to fail and will report as 'short' when using a cable tester. An open circuit is reported when there is no connection between the two ends of a cable or wire. This can occur when a wire or cable is accidentally cut in half. An open circuit is the opposite of a short circuit. Electrostatic discharge is the sudden flow of electricity between two electrically charged objects. Crosstalk is the coupling of voltage to an adjacent line through mutual coupling composed of a mutual inductance, a coupling capacitance, or both. Crosstalk occurs within a twisted pair cable when the pairs become untwisted or no shielding or insulation remains."

    "explanation": "CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol) is a proprietary protocol developed by Cisco that allows network devices to share information about their directly connected neighbors. It provides valuable information such as the device type, interface capabilities, and management IP addresses, which can assist Reginald in troubleshooting connectivity issues effectively. While LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) also serves a similar purpose and is a standardised alternative to CDP, the question specifies the use of Cisco products. STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) and SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) are not designed for discovering neighboring devices and obtaining detailed information about them."

    "question": "Terence is a network administrator troubleshooting intermittent network slowdowns reported by users in the marketing department. After gathering information and questioning users, he has duplicated the problem and established a theory that the issue is due to insufficient bandwidth caused by large file transfers during peak hours. What should be his next step in the troubleshooting methodology?",
    "options": [
      "Immediately replace all networking equipment in the marketing department.",
      "Increase the network bandwidth and document the results.",
      "Ignore the problem, since bandwidth problems often resolve themselves.",
      "Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and identify potential effects."

      "Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and identify potential effects."
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Establishing a plan of action to resolve the problem and identifying potential effects is crucial. This approach ensures you understand the root cause and implications of the proposed solution, preventing unforeseen negative impacts on network performance or user experience. It allows for a structured response to the problem, considering all variables and outcomes. Increasing the bandwidth without further analysis or planning might seem like a quick fix but may not be the most efficient or cost-effective solution. Ignoring the problem and assuming it will resolve itself without intervention is not a proactive or effective troubleshooting approach. Problems impacting network performance typically require direct action to identify and rectify. Immediately replacing all networking equipment in the marketing department without thorough investigation and planning is a hasty and potentially costly decision. This action might not address the underlying issue and could introduce new problems."

    "explanation": "An incorrect default gateway configuration prevents devices from properly routing traffic outside their local network segment. In this scenario, the devices in the remote branch office cannot communicate with external resources in the main office data centre or elsewhere due to the misconfigured default gateway. The other options represent other network issues but do not directly address the potential gateway misconfiguration which is limiting the specified access."

    "question": "Your company's network administrator has asked you to troubleshoot a connectivity issue where a remote server is not accessible from the office network. You then decide to use a command that sends ICMP echo requests to the target server to check if it is reachable and to measure round-trip time. Which tool is likely being used?",

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The ping command is the appropriate tool for sending ICMP echo requests to check the reachability of a remote server and to measure the round-trip time. traceroute/Tracert is used to determine the path packets take to reach a destination, not specifically for checking server reachability or round-trip time with ICMP echo requests. nslookup is used for querying the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain domain name or IP address mapping, not for measuring connectivity or round-trip time to a server. tcpdump is a packet analyser that captures and displays TCP/IP and other packets being transmitted or received over a network to which the computer is attached."

    "question": "During routine maintenance, you discover that one of the switch ports is configured with a VLAN ID that doesn't correspond to any VLAN on the network. Upon further investigation, you notice that the port is not passing any traffic, and there are no signs of activity. Given this situation, which term best describes the status of the port?",

      "Suspended"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Active ports typically pass traffic and show signs of activity. Since the port is not passing any traffic and lacks activity, it cannot be considered active. Disabled ports are intentionally shut down by network administrators. This port might be misconfigured but not explicitly disabled. Blocked ports are typically associated with Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and are in a state where they don't forward traffic to prevent loops. This port's lack of activity suggests a different issue. Given this, the only possible answer is suspended."

      "Penetration testing"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Penetration testing is the act of using a computer system, an individual network, or another application to find vulnerabilities that an attacker could use to compromise your systems. Penetration testing can also find endpoints with vulnerabilities, which makes the attack surface greater. Vulnerability scanning is an inspection of the potential points of exploit on a computer or network to identify security holes. A vulnerability scan detects and classifies system weaknesses in computers, networks, and communications equipment and predicts the effectiveness of countermeasures. Penetration tests are usually conducted from outside the network and may contain vulnerability scanning as well. Social engineering is the act of exploiting human weaknesses to gain access to personal information and protected systems. Session hijacking is a method of taking over a web user session by surreptitiously obtaining the session ID and masquerading as the authorised user."
