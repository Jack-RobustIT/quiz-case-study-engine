With Power BI Premium, you are licensing capacity for your content rather than licensing all users of that content. Content (datasets, dashboards, and reports) is stored in Premium and can then be viewed by as many users as you want without additional per-user costs. These users can only view content, not create it. Viewing includes looking at dashboards and reports on the web, in our mobile apps, or embedded in your organization's portals or apps. The creators of content in Premium still need their own Pro licenses. References: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-embed-report-spo"
