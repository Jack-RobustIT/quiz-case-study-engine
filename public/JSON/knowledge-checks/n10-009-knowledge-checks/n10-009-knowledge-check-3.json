To address this issue the administrator is considering installing an Ethernet bridge between the two segments.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes should the network administrator expect after installing an Ethernet bridge between Segment A and Segment B?",
    "options": [
      "The Ethernet bridge will increase the bandwidth available to Segment B.",
      "The Ethernet bridge will prevent traffic from Segment A from impacting the performance of Segment B.",

      "The Ethernet bridge will prevent traffic from Segment A from impacting the performance of Segment B."
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is that the Ethernet bridge will prevent traffic from Segment A from impacting the performance of Segment B. By installing an Ethernet bridge, the administrator effectively isolates the two segments into separate collision domains. This means that heavy traffic or collisions in Segment A will not impact the performance of Segment B, as the bridge will only forward relevant traffic between the two segments.\n\nThe Ethernet bridge does not increase the bandwidth available to any segment. It manages traffic between segments but does not add additional bandwidth.\n\nThe Ethernet bridge does the opposite of combining segments into a single collision domain; it segments the network into separate collision domains, reducing the likelihood of collisions affecting the entire network.\n\nAn Ethernet bridge operates at the Data Link layer (layer 2) and deals with MAC addresses, not IP addresses. It does not enable segments to use IP addresses from each other; IP address management is a function of layer 3 devices like routers."

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol is used in Ethernet networks to manage how devices on the same network segment transmit data. It allows devices to 'listen' to the network to ensure no other device is transmitting (Carrier Sense). If the network is clear, a device can transmit. If two devices transmit simultaneously, a collision occurs. CSMA/CD then manages the retransmission attempts after random time delays to minimize the chance of repeated collisions. This protocol is crucial in hub-based networks where all devices share the same collision domain.\n\nCSMA/CD is a network protocol that manages data transmission to avoid collisions, not a security protocol for encrypting data.\n\nCSMA/CD does not deal with IP address assignment. IP addresses are typically managed by a DHCP server or manually configured on each device.\n\nCSMA/CD does not directly affect the speed of data transmission. Its role is to minimize collisions to ensure efficient use of the network's bandwidth, not to increase the transmission speed itself."

Gigabit Ethernet and Ethernet 10 GbE cannot be deployed without using switches.\n\nNetwork adapters or network interface cards are required to join an end system host to network media and enable it to communicate over the network by assembling and disassembling frames.

For a bonded channel to be established, at least one side must be in active mode.\n\nWhen both sides are set to passive, no bonded channel is created at all, so there's no question of reduced bandwidth due to passive configuration.\n\nSince no bonded channel is created when both sides are passive, there cannot be an increase in latency due to this specific configuration.\n\nSetting both sides of a link aggregation to passive does not disable the physical links.

    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Full redundancy in the context of link aggregation is achieved when the total bandwidth of the aggregated link equals the sum of the bandwidths of all individual links. This ensures that even if one link fails, the remaining links can still provide the required bandwidth to maintain network operations without degradation in performance. This scenario represents an ideal state of redundancy where the network can sustain the loss of a link without impacting the overall functionality.\n\nWhen the business function depends on the full speed of the bonded link and one port fails, it actually describes a condition where full redundancy is not achieved. If the business function requires the full speed of the bonded link and one port fails, leading to insufficient bandwidth, then the system lacks full redundancy because it cannot maintain its required operational level in the event of a failure.\n\nThe number of network interfaces combined (in this case, two) does not directly determine whether full redundancy is achieved. Full redundancy is more about the capacity to maintain required operational levels despite a failure, not the specific number of links aggregated.\n\nThe medium of the physical links (wireless or wired) does not determine the full redundancy of link aggregation. Full redundancy is concerned with the ability to sustain operational performance despite the failure of one or more links, regardless of whether the connections are wireless or wired."
