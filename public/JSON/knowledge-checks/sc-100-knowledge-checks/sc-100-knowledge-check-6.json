    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Verifying a user's identity"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Authentication in Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be.\n\nIt ensures only valid identities can proceed to access control decisions."

      "They are incompatible with cloud backups"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["They lack modern security features like MFA"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Legacy authentication protocols like IMAP and POP3 do not support modern security controls such as MFA.\n\nBlocking them helps protect against credential-stuffing and brute-force attacks."

    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Validating every access request regardless of location"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Zero Trust operates on the principle of 'never trust, always verify.'\n\nThis means every access request is explicitly validated using multiple signals such as identity, device health, and risk, regardless of whether the request originates from inside or outside the corporate network."

    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Granular access controls within a single subnet"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Micro-segmentation enforces fine-grained controls between workloads or applications within a network segment.\n\nThis differs from macro-segmentation, which isolates larger zones such as environments or regions."

  {
    "question": "A system-assigned managed identity is deleted automatically when:",
    "options": [
      "A new admin role is assigned",
