      "question": "A healthcare organization is developing a web-based patient records system. During the testing phase, security analysts identified several injection flaws that could potentially compromise sensitive patient data. Which controls should the organization implement to mitigate the risks associated with injection flaws?",
      "options": [
        "Employ least privilege principles for database access",
        "Implement parameterized queries and input validation",
        "Use cookies to store user session data",

      "correctAnswer": ["Implement parameterized queries and input validation"],
      "type": "single",
      "explanation": "Parameterized queries help prevent structured query language (SQL) injection attacks by separating user input from the query. Input validation ensures that user input is properly checked and sanitized before processing, reducing the risk of injection attacks."
