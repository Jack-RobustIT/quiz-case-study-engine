    "question": "An IT intern prepares and connects used laptops to the company network. The intern discovers that some of the laptops have degraded performance and decreased storage. \n\n What is commonly associated with potentially unwanted programs? (Select the two best options.)",
    "options": [
      "It is software that is installed alongside a package selected by the user.",
      "It is also known as grayware or bloatware.",
      "It is malware concealed within an installer package that appears legitimate.",
      "It spreads through concealment within the executable code of another process."
    ],

    "correctAnswer": [
      "It is software that is installed alongside a package selected by the user.",
      "It is also known as grayware or bloatware."
    ],
    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "Potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) include software that is installed alongside a package selected by the user or bundled with a new computer system. PUPs are sometimes described as grayware rather than malware and can also be referred to as bloatware. A trojan is a form of malware that is concealed within an installer package for software that appears to be legitimate. Viruses and worms represent some of the first types of malware and spread without any authorization from the user by being concealed within the executable code of another process."

    "question": "A new virus is infecting computers on a segment of a company's network. \n\n Containment at the time is unknown due to the virus changing its code. What type of virus is infecting the computers?",
    "options": ["Trojan", "Boot", "Polymorphic", "Script"],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Polymorphic"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A polymorphic virus can change or attempt to obfuscate its code making it more difficult to track and remove from an infected system. A trojan virus is malware inside another file that appears legitimate. When the legitimate file executes, the trojan comes out and infects the system. A boot virus is one in which the virus code writes to the disk boot sector or the partition table of a fixed disk. The virus executes each time the operating system (OS) starts. A script virus utilizes the programming features available in a local OS or browser scripting engine. It does not change its code."

    "question": "A hacker infiltrated a company's network and made a big show of removing files and causing network connection issues. After stopping the hacker and completing the cleanup, the IT department began noticing logs of users with multiple logins at varying times.\n\n  What is the BEST explanation for how another user accessed the accounts?",
    "options": [
      "Users sharing passwords",
      "A backdoor virus",
      "A botnet",
      "Installation of a key logger"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Installation of a key logger"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "An installed key logger while everyone focused on the attacker's more significant malicious actions is the most probable cause for compromised user accounts. Users sharing passwords is a threat to the entire network and would have been readily apparent before the hacker's attack. A backdoor virus is typically not one that captures login credentials. A hacker utilizes this type of virus to regain access to a network once the company thinks its foothold is gone. A botnet is a collection of compromised computers used or sold to another hacker. Hackers typically use botnets in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, not for stealing user information."

    "question": "A company employee brought a personal computer to the IT department when it locked after receiving a file from a co-worker. The screen shows a countdown clock with a threat of encrypting files permanently unless the user pays money. \n\n  What type of virus was the user's computer MOST likely infected with? (Select the two best options.)",

      "Ransomware",
      "Crypto-ransomware",
      "Logic bomb",
      "Cryptojacking malware"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Ransomware", "Crypto-ransomware"],
    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "Ransomware is a virus that infects a computer and threatens to perform actions unless the user pays a ransom before a particular deadline. Crypto-ransomware specifically requires monetary payment before destroying the key that would allow the decryption of the user's files. A logic bomb is a specific type of virus that will only launch once reaching a specific date or a pre-scripted event happens, such as the removal of a disgruntled ex-employee's admin account. An attacker typically uses cryptojacking malware as part of a botnet to utilize hundreds or thousands of computers to complete computations such as mining the next bitcoin or digital currency."

The file the administrator is chasing gained SYSTEM-level access. \n\n  It is also cleaning logs and uses variations on known file names to remain unfound. What type of virus is the network administrator dealing with?",
    "options": ["Rootkit", "Trojan", "Malware", "Ransomware"],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Rootkit"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A rootkit is a virus that has gained SYSTEM-level access and uses these permissions to spread itself throughout the system and network while concealing its presence within the system. A trojan virus can become a rootkit if it can gain the correct permission but the scenario does not discuss permissions. Malware is any malicious software such as a virus, ransomware, trojan, or rootkit. It is a broad term and does not specifically describe the type of virus infection in this scenario. Ransomware is a virus that infects a computer and threatens to perform actions unless the user pays a ransom before a particular deadline."

      "Trojan",
      "Account compromise",
      "Denial of Service",
      "Ransomware"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Denial of Service"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A denial of service (DoS) attack uses multiple compromised machines to flood servers with repeated requests so valid requests cannot come through. These attacks consume enormous amounts of resources and can lead to inaccessibility. A trojan virus can become a rootkit if it can gain the correct permission but the scenario does not discuss permissions in this case. A compromised account would cause problems for a single user but would not result in resource consumption or resource inaccessibility for a large number of users. \n\n  Ransomware is a virus that infects a computer and threatens to perform actions unless the user pays a ransom before a particular deadline."

    "options": ["Tactic", "Technique", "Procedure", "Performance"],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Tactic", "Technique", "Procedure"],
    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "A tactic is a high-level description of a threat behavior. Behaviors such as reconnaissance, persistence, and privilege escalation are examples of tactics. Analyzing tactics helps to figure out what to expect within an attack. A technique is an intermediate-level description of how a threat actor progresses through a tactic. For example, reconnaissance such as active network scanning and email harvesting are techniques an attacker may use. A procedure is a detailed description of how an attacker uses a technique. For example, a threat actor uses a particular tool to perform vulnerability scanning. Performance does not indicate what the malicious hacker will do or potentially can do on a network."

      "Network"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Brute force (physical)"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A brute force physical attack is an attack against a physical aspect of a facility containing the physical hardware. Forcing a window and damaging HVAC equipment are excellent indicators of a brute force attack. An on-path attack is where a malicious attacker can place themselves between two recipients to intercept messages sent via the network. \n\n  A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack consumes a system's resources so legitimate requests cannot go through. A network-based attack comes over the network and does not require being physically present at the hardware's location to interfere with it."

    "question": "A hacker successfully exfiltrates a database of user passwords and attempts to gain access to it as the hacker can now go around the authentication system. What type of attack has the hacker achieved?",
    "options": ["Password spraying", "Brute force", "Dictionary", "Offline"],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Offline"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "An offline attack means the hacker has obtained a database of password hashes. The hacker can then perform attacks against this offline database in an attempt to compromise the encryption. Password spraying is a horizontal brute force online attack. In password spraying, the hacker chooses one or more common passwords and tries them in conjunction with multiple usernames. A brute force attack attempts every possible combination in the output space to match a captured hash and derive the plaintext that generated it. \n\n  A dictionary attack occurs when there is a good chance of guessing the likely value of the plaintext, such as an uncomplicated password."

    "question": "A company CEO is upset after receiving a call from a reporter at a local news station who claims that the company's network is being used as a launching point for a massive cyber attack. The reporter provides detailed IP logs showing traffic apparently originating from the company's IP addresses. However, after a thorough review, the company's network team could not find any corresponding entries in their logs or signs of compromise within their network. \n\n  What could be a possible explanation for the discrepancy between the reporter's IP logs and the company's internal findings?",

      "Domain name system-based on-path attack",
      "Domain name system attack indicators"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Domain name system poisoning"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Domain name system (DNS) poisoning is an attack in which network traffic appears to be coming from another location to confuse the company looking for an infection that does not exist. DNS client cache poisoning occurs when an attacker accesses the local client's HOST file placing a false name-to-IP address mapping in the file effectively poisoning the DNS cache to redirect traffic. Within a DNS-based on-path attack, if the threat actor has access to the same local network, the attacker can use Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning to respond to DNS queries from the victim with spoofed replies. \n\n  DNS attack indicators are bits of information from a DNS server to assist with security intelligence and attack indicators."

    "options": [
      "Rogue access point",
      "Wireless denial of service",
      "Wireless replay",
      "Downgrade attack"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Rogue access point", "Wireless denial of service"],
    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "A rogue Access Point (AP) allows a person with malicious intent to place a rogue AP with a higher power to capture usernames and passwords without getting caught immediately. A wireless denial of service attack causes network problems by not allowing users access to legitimate APs due to the rogue AP's higher signal strength. A wireless replay attack aims to capture the hashes used when a wireless station associates with an access point. Then the hash gets subjected to attacks to crack the encryption. It does not impact wireless access. A downgrade attack attempts to make a server or client use a lower specification protocol with weaker ciphers and key lengths. It does not impact wireless access."

      "Unauthorized data exfiltration"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Reconnaissance", "Unauthorized data exfiltration"],
    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "Reconnaissance involves gathering information via scans which can be difficult to differentiate between regular scans. The scanned information could then be sent off-network at regular intervals for malicious usage. The movement of data at the same time for several weeks could be indicative of unauthorized data exfiltration. A transfer of smaller files would most likely go unnoticed. A denial of service would require massive amounts of data being sent at a company's network, not information being withdrawn from it. The information in the logs represents malicious activity. Teleworkers typically leave all the work they need on the company servers and would regularly send information back and forth. The routine sending of small amounts of data indicates malicious activity."

    "correctAnswer": [
      "On-path attack",
      "Address resolution protocol poisoning"
    ],
    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "An on-path attack can occur with data possibly changing after transmission but without knowledge by the receiver or sender. In this scenario, the customer is experiencing an on-path attack. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning would redirect network traffic based on the local ARP table. ARP poisoning would create an on-path attack. A denial of service (DoS) attack would result in the customer being unable to reach the company for a period of time. However, it would not change transmitted information. Reconnaissance involves gathering information via scans which can be difficult to differentiate between regular scans. This type of attack would not change transmitted information."

      "On-path",
      "Rogue Access Point",
      "Cryptographic"
    ],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Denial of Service"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Denial of service (DoS) attack protections include high availability services such as load balancing and cluster services. Companies without these protections in place would have a hard time dealing with constant DoS attacks. An on-path attack occurs when a malicious user has found a way to intercept data transmitted before it arrives to the intended recipient. The capabilities added to the system would not protect against this attack. These types of protections would not protect against a rogue Access Point (AP) as a rogue AP attempts to gather information or perform DNS redirection. A cryptographic attack typically targets authentication systems and requires a system to use outdated or weak cryptography. The capabilities added to the system would not protect against this attack."

    "explanation": "A compromised web server could allow the malicious actor complete control over the host, giving them a foothold within the network that could be difficult to overcome. The compromised web server would allow the malicious actor to steal data directly or send information to an off-site server. A compromised server provides a malicious actor with a foothold into a company's network from which they can launch further attacks or gain information about the network's security. A compromised web server would not allow malicious actors to escalate the privileges they maintain across the entire network."

    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "A replay attack captures or guesses the token value and then submits it to reestablish the session illegitimately. A session ending and then immediately reestablishing would most likely indicate this type of attack. Cross-site Scripting (XSS) can compromise session cookies which could then lead to the prediction of future session cookies compromising all future sessions. A forgery attack attempts to hijack an ongoing authenticated session to perform some action without the user's consent. This attack would not show disconnects and reestablishments within logs.

    "explanation": "Universal Resource Locators (URLs) can encode some action or data to submit to the server host. Analysis of these URLs can provide indicators of session hijacking/replay, forgery, and injection attacks. An administrator typically configures web servers to log Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that encounters an error or traffic that matches some predefined rule set. Web servers can preserve indicators of attempted and successful replay, forgery, and injection attacks. Buffer overflow is an attack attempting to append data outside the buffer.
