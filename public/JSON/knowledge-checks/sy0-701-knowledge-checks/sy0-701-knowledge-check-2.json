    "question": "An information technology (IT) manager is trying to persuade the chief financial officer (CFO) to sign off on a new support and update contract for the company’s virtualized environment. The CFO sees this as a waste of money since the company already has the environment up and running. The IT manager explained to the CFO that the company will no longer receive security updates to protect the environment. \n\n  What describes the level of hazard posed by NOT keeping the systems up-to-date?",
    "options": ["Vulnerability", "Threat", "Risk", "Insider threat"],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Risk"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Risk is the level of hazard posed by vulnerabilities and threats. When a company identifies a vulnerability, it calculates the risk as the likelihood of exploitation by a threat actor and the impact of a successful exploitation. \n\n Vulnerability is a weakness capable of exploitation either accidentally or intentionally to cause a security breach. \n\n Threat is the potential for someone or something to exploit a vulnerability and breach security. A threat can have an intentional motivation or it can be unintentional. \n\n An insider threat is someone within the company who intentionally or unintentionally increases risk or takes company data outside the organization’s security controls."

    "explanation": "An insider threat is someone within the company (internal) who intentionally or unintentionally increases risk or takes company data outside the organization’s security controls. \n\n An external threat actor has no account or authorized access to the target system. A malicious external threat must infiltrate the security system using unauthorized access such as breaking into a building or hacking into a network. \n\n Nation-state actors are the root cause of many attacks, particularly on energy, health, and electoral systems. The goals of state actors are primarily disinformation and espionage for strategic advantage. \n\n Hacktivists might attempt to use data exfiltration to obtain and release confidential information to the public domain, perform service disruption attacks, or deface websites to spread disinformation."

Antivirus software that cannot update automatically may fail to address these new threats quickly, leaving clients' systems exposed to emerging security risks. \n\n While not purchasing software does save money, it is not necessarily the main concern for a third-party managed service provider. Instead, a managed service provider would focus on ensuring security while minimizing effort. \n\n Less effort will occur when a company does not purchase the software. However, automation is the better solution to decrease efforts for a managed service provider. \n\n More effort will occur as the managed service provider will now need to find another comparable solution that fits its needs of automatic updating. However, this is not the ideal solution."

    "explanation": "Sending out an email with an attachment with similar wording as a company would expect is an excellent way to get people to click them accidentally. Adding additional content to the email can help add legitimacy to the malicious attachment. \n\n A physical lure may involve a phone call, a dropped thumb drive, or in-person social engineering. \n\n Malicious attachments typically do not improve an employee's workflow and will likely cause the opposite. They would cause a disruption to the employee's workflow. \n\n Attackers exploiting outdated email encryption protocols aim to intercept emails, unlike deceiving an employee into clicking on a malicious attachment through social engineering."

    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A physical lure can occur when an attacker leaves something such as a removable flash drive in an area in which a targeted person would use the device in the work environment. \n\n Sending out an email with an attachment with similar wording as a company would expect is an excellent way to get people to click them accidentally. However, the scenario mentions a dropped thumb drive. \n\n Typically, a malicious actor is not trying to improve a company's security posture but rather to exploit an employee's ignorance of the risk. \n\n It is possible that a person dropping a thumb drive is not malicious; however, dropping multiple thumb drives around the entrance of a building is more likely to have malicious intent."

    "correctAnswer": ["Every vendor is at risk of threats."],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "There are risks when using any software, including third-party vendor services or software. It is important to analyze a vendor’s security posture to protect against breaches. \n\n Costs are typically cheaper using a third party for a task or software. However, in the case of password managers, free alternatives eliminate this as an option. \n\n Simply using a third-party vendor does not necessarily lower the risk. In some instances, it increases the risk to a company even more than developing something internally. \n\n Not being able to hire talent for a specific role can limit what a company can accomplish internally and may force its hand to export a task or project externally."

    "explanation": "By bringing things in-house, a company can limit risk in relation to supply-chain attacks. \n\n Bringing things in-house typically increases the risk of insider threats. It is crucial to implement security controls to ensure that insider risks are minimal. \n\n With nation-state threats, whether the company manages its infrastructure and software internally or externally is not necessarily less risky. It depends significantly on a company’s ability to manage its security posture. \n\n Bringing things in-house does not necessarily improve a company’s security posture. It is dependent on its ability to implement security controls properly."
