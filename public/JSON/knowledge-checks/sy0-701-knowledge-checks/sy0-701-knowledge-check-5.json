    "correctAnswer": ["Wireless access point"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Wireless access points provide a bridge between a cabled network and wireless hosts or stations. Access points work at layer 2 of the OSI model. Wireless devices also use MAC addressing at layer 2. \n\n Switches forward frames between nodes in a cabled network. The network adapter in each host is connected to a switch port via a cable. \n\n Routers send packets around an internetwork making forwarding decisions based on Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Routers work at layer 3 of the OSI model. \n\n Transport protocols allow clients to exchange data with application servers. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) establishes reliable connections while the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) allows unreliable connectionless transfers."

    "options": ["Port security", "Costs", "Availability", "Risk Transference"],
    "image": "",
    "correctAnswer": ["Port security"],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Port Security is not considered an architectural consideration but does prevent a device attached to a switch port from communicating on the network unless it matches a given MAC address or other protection profile. \n\n Costs are a consideration in that architecture changes and the acquisition and upgrade of appliances and software require an up-front capital outlay which can depreciate and lose value. \n\n Availability is also an architectural consideration as it minimizes downtime or maximizes uptime. \n\n Risk Transference involves transferring the risk to another entity such as through insurance or contractual agreements which can affect architectural considerations by altering who is responsible for managing certain risks."

      "Segregate with VLANs and control inter-VLAN traffic with ACLs."
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "VLANs with ACLs create secure segments providing effective internal traffic control without affecting other layers. This approach not only enhances network performance but also significantly improves security by isolating different network segments. \n\n A WAF secures web traffic at the application layer but does not segregate the network to limit access or visibility between services. \n\n Router ACLs and IPsec enhance security but do not change the flat network structure leaving segmentation issues unaddressed. \n\n A DMZ with port security isolates external-facing services adding a layer of protection without altering internal network access."

This practice is necessary for cloud and traditional network architectures to maintain a strong security posture. \n\n The phrase \"local networks\" emphasizes data transmission within the confines of a particular physical location or company infrastructure. However, it aligns more with traditional network architecture than cloud architecture. \n\n For traditional network architectures a heightened emphasis exists on ensuring controlled physical access to network devices preventing unauthorized interventions.

Consequently they must implement rigorous access control measures to thwart unauthorized access or tampering. \n\n Whether in the cloud or traditional setups IT professionals consistently prioritize data encryption as it moves between points. This encryption is a robust barrier against malicious entities trying to intercept or compromise the data. \n\n Service providers in cloud architectures take an active role in overseeing the physical infrastructure and its security.

It is vital in both cloud and on-premises environments. \n\n Segmenting the network can isolate potential threats and prevent them from moving laterally across the enterprise. It is particularly essential as enterprises grow and diversify their digital assets. \n\n Allowing all outbound traffic without scrutiny can lead to data exfiltration or connections to malicious domains. It is essential to monitor and control outbound traffic based on organizational needs. \n\n While centralized storage can provide some benefits not having backups poses a significant risk of data loss. Maintaining backups is crucial especially with the rise of ransomware attacks targeting enterprise data."

Network segmentation limits an attacker's ability to move laterally within a network thereby minimizing the attack surface. \n\n Enabling more ports unnecessarily or without adequate security measures increases the potential entry points for malicious actors thereby enlarging the attack surface rather than minimizing it. \n\n While redundancy increases network availability it does not directly contribute to reducing the attack surface or defining security zones. \n\n While SSO can enhance user experience and streamline access management it does not directly minimize the attack surface or contribute to defining security zones."

It divides a network into multiple segments or subnets each acting as a separate network thus isolating potential security threats and containing them within a particular segment. \n\n While deploying firewalls at the edge of every network can provide some level of protection it is not as comprehensive as network segmentation which offers an additional layer of defense. \n\n Prioritizing public networks over private networks can expose the enterprise to more potential threats and vulnerabilities increasing rather than minimizing the attack surface. \n\n Ensuring all devices use the same credentials is a bad security practice as it does not provide granular control over network resources."
