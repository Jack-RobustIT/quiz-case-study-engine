      "The application of the change budget within the authorized constraints to make trade-offs"
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "As part of the 'change budget' element of the effective guidance, “the project manager should ensure that delegated authority is accompanied by an appropriate change budget from which approved changes can be delivered. The change budget is usually an amount of money earmarked specifically to fund changes. However, it can also be defined as a set of authorized constraints within which trade-offs can be made.” It is by applying the change budget that approved changes can be funded and therefore implemented.
