      "explanation": "The requirement states that **when the confidence score is lower than 70 percent, the response must be improved by human input**.\n\nReceiptType has a confidence of **0.672**, which is below 0.7.\n\nMerchantName is above 0.7 (0.913), and checking all fields with a wildcard is not valid expression syntax. The docType comparison does not reflect the confidence requirement."

Webinars typically contain domain-specific terms, product names, and jargon that are not in the general dictionary of the default speech-to-text model. A **custom language model** in Azure AI Video Indexer (built using Azure AI Speech Services) is trained on relevant text data (like presentation notes or documentation) to significantly improve the accuracy of transcribing this specialized vocabulary. This ensures the high-quality source material needed for a reliable knowledgebase."
